			<p>Dear comrades,</p>
			<p class="spacer-1x"></p>
			<p>
				Here are some thoughts on the eve of the PB meeting.</p>
			<p>
				The death of every communist and socialist organization in the
			United States has come through political liquidation into the
			Democratic Party. Not all, but much of the very little political
			discussion we&rsquo;ve had in the SL/U.S. seems incidental and
			tangential, based on the wrong political premises, narrow in scope,
			and in the wrong political framework. Aligning with U.S. imperialism
			abroad via the Democratic Party, domestically capitulating to the
			capitalist state via Black Lives Matter, abandoning the fight against
			forcible segregation, and arguments about who emboldens the fascists
			do require investigation and correction. But we can&rsquo;t fight our
			way out of the liberal muck unless we see what is fundamental and
			ties all these examples of betrayals together. We gave up the fight
			to <i>finish the Civil War</i>. That is our program for black
			liberation and the American proletarian socialist revolution. They go
			together, not singularly &ldquo;in their own right.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>
				Every problem the American working class and the oppressed confront
			today comes directly out of capitalist counterrevolution in the
			former Soviet Union and East Europe, the unfinished American Civil
			War, and the defeat of Radical Reconstruction: U.S. imperialist
			expansion, citizenship rights, immigration, wage slavery,
			incarceration, integration/segregation, education, voting rights,
			land and property ownership, women&rsquo;s rights, organizing labor
			unions, and more. The big lie in American society is that bourgeois
			democracy and suffrage rights to elect a government of the class
			enemy are the road to black power, equality, and justice. (I take
			issue with J.&rsquo;s document on one point: we do not defend
			bourgeois democracy, which is the dictatorship of the capitalist
			class. We defend democratic rights and proletarian rights by fighting
			for them through class struggle.)</p>
			
			<p>
				The discussion on forcible segregation, now and in 2011, seems to
			miss the main point. Segregation is not merely separation.
			Segregation in a race- and class-divided society means domination. In
			the U.S., it means white supremacy. Isn&rsquo;t it ridiculous to
			debate whether a capitalist economy, founded on chattel slavery and
			still resting on the subjugation  of blacks, is &ldquo;<i>de facto&rdquo;
			</i>or &ldquo;<i>de jure&rdquo;</i>? S.&rsquo;s document on our
			defense of racially-segregated unions in longshore is important and
			true. The party&rsquo;s longstanding acquiescence to segregation is
			copasetic with the maximum program of Black Lives Matter for better
			segregated schools and better police. The radical Abolitionist
			Thaddeus Stevens would be turning over in his grave in the black
			cemetery where he chose to buried to make the point in death that he
			fought for in life.</p>
			
			<p>
				<a href="../../a/docs/doc-e-a-001-005.html" id="capitul1"></a>
				Black trade union bureaucrats are perhaps the most active popular
			constituency of the Democratic Party. The SL/U.S. has capitulated to
			these most effective labor lieutenants of capital. In doing so, our
			trajectory toward liquidation into the capitalist Democratic Party
			had the veneer of an an orientation to the black proletariat. Ditto
			the Mumia campaign, when the party leadership vigorously opposed
			carrying a banner against the Democratic Party in a Philadelphia demo
			on the eve of the 2008 Democratic Primary, and raised a Mumia banner
			as our maximum program in an Obama rally the night before. Rather
			than repeat myself, I am appending the political excerpts of a letter
			to D. that I submitted for discussion many months ago regarding when
			we began liquidating into the Democratic Party via black elected
			officials and trade union bureaucrats.</p>
			
			<p>
			
				The draft PB memo screams opportunism in fear of itself. Just as the
			PB couldn&rsquo;t say the name Trump in draft election statements,
			just as it couldn&rsquo;t answer the &ldquo;anybody but Trump&rdquo;
			fever and feared capitulating to it, so now the PB trivializes the
			riot at the Capitol on January 6th by laughably calling it &ldquo;an
			interruption.&rdquo; Five people died. Were they &ldquo;interrupted?&rdquo;
			Trump <i><b>did</b></i><i> </i>incite a riot by a Confederate
			flag-waving, Auschwitz-saluting, fascist-infested, evangelical mob.
			They rampaged against the ascension to the presidency of Trump&rsquo;s
			bourgeois rival, Joseph Biden, whose political career was made
			brokering deals with the southern Dixiecrat party bosses of the Ku
			Klux Klan and presiding over mass incarceration and increased
			segregation as Clinton&rsquo;s Vice President. So look who&rsquo;s
			calling who &ldquo;fascist.&rdquo; Liberals and reformists are
			apoplectic that the police failed to protect the Capitol, the shrine
			of American democracy, built on the bones of millions of black
			slaves. Trump&rsquo;s impeachment is truly a show trial by the wrong
			class for the wrong crime. (An interesting anecdote I can&rsquo;t
			resist: Jamie Raskin, the head of the Democratic Party impeachment
			proceedings is a failed contact of ours from Harvard University in
			the early 1980s. In our last argument, he said, &ldquo;twenty years
			from now you&rsquo;ll still be an irrelevant sect. I replied, &ldquo;and
			you&rsquo;ll be in Congress saving capitalism.&rdquo;)</p>
			
			<p>
			
				The entire Democratic Party-loyal spectrum, from the ruling class to
			Black Lives Matter is clamoring (or providing a left cover, in the
			case of the IG) for increased state repression of the right.
			Increased state repression under Democratic Party rule, bolstered by
			reformists demanding that the capitalist state &ldquo;do the right
			thing&rdquo; is the historic norm in this country. It would be useful
			to reference the jailing of 18 leaders of the Socialist Workers Party
			under the Smith Act. Liberals demanded that legislation to curb hate
			speech and rallies by the fascist German-American Bund, but of course
			it was used against the Trotskyists for leading a general strike in
			Minneapolis and opposing World War II. Collusion between the state
			and the fascists on January 6th, expressed in the hands-off wink at
			the rioters, is nothing new either. From Gary Rowe and the Birmingham
			Church bombing, to the Greensboro massacre to the leader of the Proud
			Boys serving as an FBI informer&mdash;both parties of the capitalist
			class keep the fascists in reserve and unleash them at will.</p>
			
			<p>
			
				I agree with much of what J. wrote about how <i>WV&rsquo;s</i>
			repeated bleating that &ldquo;Trump emboldens the fascists&rdquo; was
			a plug for the Democrats. It&rsquo;s also anti-Marxist. Fascism
			doesn&rsquo;t spring from Trump&rsquo;s mouth. What is the material
			basis for the growth of fascism? Capitalist counterrevolution across
			the former East European states and the Soviet Union gave a huge
			boost to fascism&mdash;worldwide&mdash;as everyone except the new
			capitalist rulers was devastated. The fascists have been steadily
			growing in the United States since the early 1980s, when they began
			their incursions into urban centers. Their growth is in inverse
			proportion to the decline of the organized labor movement and the
			immiserization of the petty bourgeoisie. Recall that the 1980s began
			with smashing PATCO and decimating once-powerful integrated unions
			like the UAW, aided and abetted by trade union bureaucrats like Doug
			Fraser, who swapped the lives of thousands of workers for a seat on
			Chrysler&rsquo;s board of directors. When white workers are
			manipulated to believe that they are better than and threatened by
			black people and immigrants, no labor movement can succeed. The &ldquo;open
			shop&rdquo; South has taken over the north.</p>
			
			<p>
			
				It is an empirical fact that the United States, especially in its
			urban centers, is rapidly becoming a majority minority country. This
			too has fueled the growth of the fascists. As J2. pointed out in a
			discussion at the PRL last week, the fascists had a big growth spurt
			in response to Obama&rsquo;s election. Stoking white fear of economic
			ruin by blacks and immigrant labor also dates directly back to the
			defeat of Reconstruction and the unfinished Civil War.</p>
			
			<p>
			
				I appreciate the reports at the IEC meeting every time I re-read
			them. I wish I didn&rsquo;t need the continued sharp interventions by
			the IEC to see things myself, but I&rsquo;m not there yet. The
			interventions by J3, S., J4. were a deflection of this fight and
			pushback against the IEC. Did those of us, including myself, not
			build &ldquo;a different kind of party&rdquo; since at least the
			1990s? In her report to the IEC meeting, E. took responsibility for
			what she did. She is trying to lead this party together in more
			difficult circumstances than any of us ever faced. The arguments
			against our 1977 article struck a nerve with many party veterans. We
			fought the barrage of attacks that our party and Jim Robertson
			personally were &ldquo;racist&rdquo; because we defended the right of
			every person to exist, regardless of race or ethnicity. &ldquo;Presentism&rdquo;
			is a &ldquo;politically correct&rdquo; deformity. The takeaway point
			from this sorry episode is to investigate and learn something about
			history and context before launching attacks.</p>
			
			<p>
			
				I agree that this surge of liberal race-baiting was rooted in
			opportunism. The delegation and PB indulged in inverted
			Anglo-chauvinism, importing &ldquo;check your privilege, whitey&rdquo;
			politics as a club within our own party. If the IEC delegation and PB
			believed their own allegations of racism, why didn&rsquo;t they do
			anything? If they seriously thought there was a color bar at the PRL,
			why didn&rsquo;t they fight it? Nobody talked to me, nobody talked to
			J5., <i>nobody talked to H.</i>, but apparently plenty of people &ldquo;in
			the know&rdquo; talked to each other a whole lot in the corridors.
			The intended effect was to ostracize and shun comrades to consolidate
			one more politically insecure and deficient regime on a cliquist
			basis.</p>
			
			<p>
			
				The PB could have used the hard-hitting points from V.&rsquo;s
			letter about how race-baiting destroys parties. Instead, the PB had
			an urge to gush an apology to G., who quit at the first challenge to
			her command. Everybody gets roughed up in politics, sometimes
			wrongly. That shouldn&rsquo;t override the commitment to building a
			Trotskyist party.  Cannon said that when he got involved in politics,
			he learned to put on an old pair of pants. H. is a 50-year-cadre, one
			of precisely two comrades left in the SL/U.S. (to my knowledge) with
			a history of working in the south to fight Jim Crow (not to mention a
			central party leader in the SL/U.S. and I.S. who worked with Jim on
			most every split and fusion that built the ICL). And still, nobody on
			the PB has talked to her, much less apologized. The apology will be
			made by learning something and fighting for the cadre that we have.</p>
			
			<p>
			
				I accept that the IEC leadership in London did not know the extent
			of the political damage until they read E.&rsquo;s report two months
			after the events. But they did know they had a rogue delegation on
			their hands. Sharing that information with the IEC and SL/U.S. CC
			might have helped. It certainly would have blown the cover off false
			unity. We do not (perhaps not yet) have declared factions. The ICL
			does not believe in the discipline of higher party bodies with regard
			to political discussion.</p>
			
			<p>
			
				I agree that cohering an international leadership is the top
			priority for the survival of the ICL. It&rsquo;s no small feat that
			comrades have made real progress, in the midst of the pandemic and at
			considerable personal hardship, to move around the world. The SL/U.S.
			does need propaganda on the Democratic Party in power, but I was
			happy to read in Perrault&rsquo;s last cover letter that the new I.S.
			will soon turn its attention to the COVID pandemic&mdash;not because
			I want to stop the fight with the SL/U.S., but because we need to
			grapple with the crisis that the proletariat faces worldwide.
			Thinking more broadly than the U.S. may also help the SL/U.S. reverse
			its refractory disintegration. There is no end in sight to this
			pandemic, which has intensified all the horrors and misery of
			capitalism worldwide. &ldquo;Lockdown&rdquo; increasingly seems to be
			the euphemism for &ldquo;crackdown&rdquo; against the proletariat and
			political protest. Despite incursions of capital and extreme scarcity
			(Cuba), the workers states are doing a notably better job (Vietnam).
			It will be difficult to distill a sharp international statement from
			a vast vat of description that may be interesting but is not
			essential. I hope that reports and discussion about COVID will lead
			to an ICL statement.</p>

			<p>
			Dear D.,</p>

			<p>
			
				[&hellip;]</p>
			

			<p>
			
				You asked if I had any thoughts on how we got to the point of
			embellishing the results of the Civil Rights Movement. Yes, I do.
			While a lot more research could and should be done, I&rsquo;ve looked
			into back issues of <i>WV </i>to verify my memories of two episodes:
			the 1994 Springfield Labor/Black Mobilization to stop the KKK and the
			1996 reprisals against the TWU for striking against the Taylor law. I
			don&rsquo;t have access to the PB minutes  or<i> IB</i>s to review.</p>

			<p>
			
				In 1994, the Ku Klux Klan picked Martin Luther King day to rally for
			racist genocide in eight states. The PDC initiated a labor/black
			mobilization to stop them. Of course, the Klan did not target MLK day
			because King tied the Civil Rights Movement to the Democratic Party.
			They picked that date to terrorize every black man, woman, and child
			in America. Polemicizing against King in the course of building this
			demo was tricky. It would have been inappropriate to do so in the
			short PDC call for a united front demo. But our party propaganda in
			campaigning for this labor/black mobilization (we even put out a <i>WV
			</i>supplement) and our post-demo &ldquo;lessons to be learned&rdquo;
			propaganda are flaming evidence of a dive into the black Democratic
			Party milieu. 
			</p>

			<p>
			
				This was our first initiative for a mass labor/black mobilization in
			the post-Soviet world and we knew it would be an important test for
			us in the &ldquo;new world order.&rdquo; This demonstration also
			coincided with the liquidation of the American section into the Mumia
			campaign. Far from saying &ldquo;everything that needs to be said&rdquo;
			about the black question in America, this campaign was the party&rsquo;s
			plunge into single-issue reformism, which always leads to the
			Democratic Party. We endlessly pursued black Democratic Party
			politicians and trade union bureaucrats to give the Mumia campaign
			the illusion of a mass base among black people. The trade union
			bureaucrats we chased were the generation of black union leaders who
			had walked holes in their shoe leather following Martin Luther King.
			Clearly, criticism of the politics of the Civil Rights Movement was
			softened or erased. Al and I were the on site leadership for this
			mobilization. I have more than an equal share of responsibility with
			the Political Bureau and Central Committee for this programmatic
			dive. The problem was our political framework, not individual cadres.</p>

			<p>
			
				In mobilizing for Springfield, we emphasized the racism of the
			Clinton administration a whole lot more than our class opposition to
			this capitalist party of the ruling class&mdash;and particularly the
			racism <i>within </i>the Democratic Party. The front page article in
			<i>WV</i> no. 592 decries the
			Democrats for turning Jesse Jackson into an invisible man and
			maneuvering to oust black city mayors from office. Every single
			reference to a black Democratic Party leader is positive. The next
			issue, we ran a long presentation by Al Nelson to the Bay Area youth
			and party branches, drawing the lessons of Springfield (see &ldquo;A
			Proletarian-Centered Strategy to Fight Fascism&mdash;Revolutionary
			Consciousness is Key). In this presentation, the Democrats are not
			portrayed as the class enemy and the single major obstacle to
			building a revolutionary workers party. Rather, Al envisions a
			seamless transition for black Democratic Party leaders to the SL:</p>

			<p>
			
			&ldquo;These
			Democrats who want to struggle have a very big contradiction: black
			people need a party that will fight for their interests. It is
			currently abundantly clear that that cannot happen within the
			Democratic Party. If a workers party with some social weight existed,
			some of the more serious of these black Democrats would very likely
			come over to such a party. And in fact in this instance, this
			microcosm of that equation, that's what happened. In this one- or
			two-week period, they did join forces with this small vanguard
			formation.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				The
			lead article in the supplement, presents King as a good guy who was
			unfortunately tethered to the Democratic Party, not an active
			opponent of politically independent mobilizations by blacks and labor
			movement. We have <i>no </i>criticism
			of the Civil Rights Movement or its leadership, just: &lsquo;&hellip;that
			movement was shattered in Chicago [in 1966], where it came up against
			the segregation and discrimination against blacks in the North, who
			for years had lived with &quot;equality under the law.&quot; Tied to
			the Democratic Party, Martin Luther King Jr. could not fight the root
			cause of black oppression-the rule of American capitalism.&rdquo;
			There is the obligatory tip of the hat in the last paragraph of the
			article: &ldquo;The Democrats and Republicans represent their class,
			the bourgeoisie. A workers party, built on an internationalist
			perspective, is needed &hellip;&rdquo;.</p>

			<p>
				B.
			gave the party speech at the rally continues this portrayal of black
			Civil Rights Leaders as victims of the Democrats, saying that the
			promise of black freedom was &ldquo;dashed&rdquo;
			and Martin Luther King was &ldquo;stopped.&rdquo; So the problems are
			external to the Civil Rights Movement, not that the politics and
			program of the CRM chained labor and the oppressed to the capitalist
			Democratic Party. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The
			best political arguments were presented by JH, speaking for the Bay
			Area Labor/Black League.:</p>
			<p>
			
			&ldquo;In
			1877 with the defeat of Reconstruction and the pulling of Union
			troops out of the South, the young American capitalist class made a
			deal with remnants of the defeated slaveowners, and through it, its
			paramilitary arm-the Ku Klux Klan. The surging American capitalists,
			largely responding to a growing, organizing labor movement, were
			abandoning any perspective for a socially founded black freedom. The
			Ku Klux Klan was employed as the primary paramilitary force, the
			armed battering ram, which forcibly drove the former slaves to the
			bottom of American industrial capitalist society. It is not status as
			an oppressed nation, but this condition, determined on the one hand
			by fundamental integration into America's capitalist economic fabric,
			while on the other forcibly segregated on its bottom as a race-color
			caste, which is at the foundation of the sordid, horrible, wretched,
			agonizing living conditions for AfroAmericans today!</p>

			<p>
			
			&ldquo;The
			key to working-class unity, to working-class victory, is independence
			from all forces linked to the bourgeoisie. Working-class
			schoolchildren today grow up knowing that the Republican Party has
			represented big money interests for a long time, that the ReaganBush
			safety net was in fact a hangman's noose. But it must also be learned
			that the Democrats too are tied to big money going back to the days
			when the Democratic Party served as the political tool for the
			slaveowners. Malcolm X was right: a Democrat is nothing but a
			Dixiecrat.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>
				The
			other episode I recalled in response to your question about when did
			we embellish the Civil Rights Movement was the party&rsquo;s
			response to the jailing of black TWU president Toussaint in 1996.
			Toussaint was jailed and the union was severely punished by the state
			for waging a strike in defiance of the Taylor Law. Black Democratic
			Party politicos rallied to Toussaint and declared him the new Martin
			Luther King and Rosa Parks. <i>WV</i> apparently
			agreed (see articles in <i>WV</i> nos.
			866 and 868). The absence of polemic against the TWU leadership was
			decried by C. M. who wrote a letter to <i>WV</i> (the BT also polemicized against us). We replied that you can&rsquo;t
			criticize a union leadership when it is under attack. I need to think
			about this more. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At
			the time, I wrote a note to the PB and <i>WV
			</i> criticizing
			the uncritical portrayal of the Civil Rights Movement and its
			leadership. My document wasn&rsquo;t circulated. I went to the
			unusual step of submitting my document a second time, and again it
			wasn&rsquo;t circulated. I don&rsquo;t have a copy and while it
			probably said nothing profound, it was a suppressed internal
			criticism of the publicly embellishing the Civil Rights Movement and
			its leaders. I was told, &ldquo;there are worse things than being a
			Civil Rights leader.&rdquo; True, but &ldquo;lesser evilism&rdquo; is
			not Trotskyism.&rdquo; 
			</p>

			<p>
			
				The new party leaders in the
			international are tired of hearing me and others talk about the
			demise of the Soviet Union as a reason for the SL&rsquo;s
			departures from revolutionary Marxism. I don&rsquo;t want to
			oversimplify or use that as an excuse. But as we review our past,
			that world-changing defeat for the proletariat will stand out as a
			qualitative turning point. We were a rock hard Soviet-defensist party
			and, as such, it wasn&rsquo;t really possible to position ourselves
			in the Democratic Party&rsquo;s big tent. It&rsquo;s troubling that
			while we spilled a lot of ink about the &ldquo;retrogression of
			consciousness,&rdquo; we were seemingly unaware of our own
			degeneration on the black question and the Democratic Party.</p>
			
				<p>
				I hope this is of some use to you and L. in your pursuit of this
			question. Please do let me know if there is more digging you would
			like me to do. It was wonderful to have an assignment!</p>

			<p>
			Comradely,</p>
