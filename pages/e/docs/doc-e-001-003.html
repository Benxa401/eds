            National Report </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> We
            think it is important for the party to be against lockdown and not
            pick and choose measures. We had a discussion and K. 
            and D. think that we must not support but also not oppose the ban
            of travel (in accordance to the motion from South Africa). J. is
            not convinced if should approach separately specific lockdown
            measures and thinks that further discussion is needed. The
            bourgeoisie has imposed lockdown transferring the burden to the
            working class, leftists, youth, Roma, immigrants and refugees. It&rsquo;s
            workers that suffer from loss of work, loss of pay, instability,
            immiseration and death from other disease because of the demands from
            Covid. The petty bourgeoisie is also suffering. 
            We hope that our report will help the discussion on how to approach
            these questions. Only with the dictatorship of the proletariat would
            a pandemic be rationally controlled.This is impossible under
            capitalism because their main interest is not the well-being of the
            population but the continuation of profits for the bourgeoise. </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> Since
            the beginning of the pandemic police are out in force stopping
            people, demanding papers and giving fines for unessential movement.
            In order to leave home if you work you need a paper from your
            employer with the time of your work schedule, if you do not work you
            need to either text the state or have a signed paper with you with
            reason you are on the streets; there are 6 reasons allowable (see our
            report: Covid and capitalist government.18April20). We are in
            opposition to this intrusion of everyday movement.  <i><b>No
            government monitoring of the population&rsquo;s whereabouts! </b></i>  
            </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> Under
            the guise of law, order, and anti-virus mandates the Greek state
            reinforces the machinery of repression. Greece now has the third
            largest number of police of countries in the EU (per capita), after
            Cyprus and Malta. Police now respond to demonstrations during the
            lockdowns to an even greater degree of repression kettling them,
            meting out beatings, tear gas, water cannons, fines and arrests.   
            </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> Unemployment
            in Greece is the highest of all EU member countries at 18.3 as of
            July 2020 by official count (seasonally adjusted, whatever that
            means) so it must be much higher. Public health under the pandemic
            has been hit even harder with 5,000 fewer employees compared to 2019
            and 550 million less for healthcare in the 2021 budget.   
            </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> An
            example of who makes money under crisis is the  Greek
            shipowners who invested the last 12 months 9 billion euros in new and
            second-hand ships buying a total of 318 merchant ships. Greece
            remains the world's largest shipowner. Although the population
            represents only 0.16% of the world's population ,
            Greek shipowners hold
            20.67% of the world's capacity to transport goods with ships and
            54.28% of the European Union's capacity.  </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p>
            Of course, there was no plan
            for public transportation to allow for social distancing, it
            remains packed with people during rush hours, likely spreading
            the virus. This disproportionately affects workers and immigrants who
            cannot afford to travel to work by car. [pas de revendications?] </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> In
            Athens, about 500 buses are idle because the government does not buy
            spare parts to fix them, as part of its plan to privatise the public
            transport system. Those labeled &ldquo;essential&rdquo; i.e.,
            delivery workers and grocery store workers receive paltry salaries
            and no protective equipment and pay for them themselves. </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> The
            lockdown fines are a cash cow for the government: bringing in &frac12;
            million euros per day (according to the police). Not only targeting
            retail operations police have ticketed many people trying to give
            supplies to homeless people or people locked in refugee or Roma
            camps. A friend and public sector worker reports of daily harassment
            of immigrants and youth in the immigrant area of Omonia on her way to
            and from work. She has never been questioned. The industrial areas of
            Athens have been some of the hardest hit by the virus and by the
            government. The police also target immigrants and youth and have
            established checkpoints in poorer working class and immigrant
            neighborhoods. The lockdown measures are worse in those areas where
            there is a ban of movement from 6 p.m. - 5 a.m. only allowing people
            to move in order to go to work. </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> In
            the public sector half of the personnel is working from home, in many
            private companies&rsquo; numbers of employees are also working from
            home. This primarily concerns the petite bourgeoisie. This is new
            because of the pandemic but there is the danger of it becoming
            <i><b>permanent </b></i> for
            some workers. The question is not if someone would prefer to work
            from his/her home but what will be the outcome of having the workers
            so atomized and locked inside the &ldquo;family house&rdquo;. The
            Prime Minister stated recently that
            &ldquo; Teleworking
            that we were forced for public health reasons to impose on the state
            gives us the opportunity to think about how we can integrate it in a
            more organized way into the everyday life, the working life of the
            state, when we have left behind the pandemic.&rdquo; At the same time
            research from the co-federation of the unions (GSEE) declares that
            &ldquo;65% of the workers finds it negative that they have to work
            from home, 56% had reduction on the salary during the pandemic, 65%
            said that working from home means working more hours, 54% that it
            goes against their workers&rsquo; rights and 52% that it has negative
            consequences on their personal life.&rdquo;    
            </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> We
            had a discussion where D. and J. had different approach on the
            question. D. initially thought we should not have a position on
            the subject and was sympathetic to individuals preferring to work at
            home. On the other hand, J. believe that it can be harmful for
            the individual worker as well as for the working movement as a whole.
            Some of the reasons include: the isolation from society, the
            isolation from co-workers, being atomized, the difficulty of
            organizing and educating the workers without physical presence in the
            unions, in the meetings etc. Workers bare the cost of work from home
            (computers, printers, space in their house) and not to forget that
            the main burden is once again to the women - she has to be able to
            take care of the kids and do her work from home without getting out
            of the house. The only ones who will win from such a situation are
            the bosses because the cost will be on the workers and additional to
            that they will have even less expenses i.e., rent, bills etc.   
            [Conclusion, revendications?]  </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> <b>Anti
            working-class laws </b>  
            </p>
            <p> All
            the anti working-class measures are under the dictates of the EU and
            the blackmail preconditions for financial assistance.  The
            bill&mdash;under which the organizers are also accountable for any
            &ldquo;damage&rdquo; caused by the protesters&mdash;was pushed
            through by the government, which includes, among other things, a
            'licence to protest', the prohibition of public gatherings, the
            arrest of those who want to protest collectively. One
            of the laws says a demo can be declared illegal if it &ldquo;disrupts
            the social-economic life of the area.&rdquo; So, any demo can be
            declared illegal.  Some
            of new laws they want to vote under the procedure of &ldquo;emergency&rdquo;
            due to Covid are: to increase government control over the unions,
            creating &ldquo;files&rdquo; with participants in the unions,
            meetings and reduce the ability of workers to strike. According to
            the government&rsquo;s proposal &ldquo;essential personnel&rdquo; in
            the public sector can never shut down fully during a strike. They
            always need at least 40% of the work force. The law also applies to
            every sector that has to do with the public like ports,
            transportations and only half of the workers can strike each time.  </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> The
            bill states that &ldquo; <i>blocking of
            entrances or any other work place as well as the use of psychological
            or physical violence are prohibited. If they take place, the strike
            becomes illegal. Those who engage in occupation or violence are going
            to be accused of a criminal act</i> &rdquo;.
            In other words, picket lines, the
            possibility of leafleting outside the workplace, or placards outside
            factory gates and workplaces can be characterized as obstruction or
            as an exercise of &quot;psychological violence&quot; making strikes
            illegal.  </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> The
            law impedes strike votes. There will be no general assemblies in
            person, the workers will vote electronically if they are in favor of
            striking. A 50%+1 vote is needed to strike (this was initially
            proposed by SYRIZA government) and the database with who voted what
            will be available to management and the government. They change the 8
            hour workday.  &ldquo;Companies will employ
            workers up to a maximum of 10 hours a  day,
            without additional pay.&rdquo;  Its only
            obligation will be to &quot;pay&quot; the additional hours of work
            &quot;within the same 6 months&quot; with a corresponding reduction
            in hours or days off. Additional to that, they increase legal
            overtime and include more businesses in the list of those who can
            operate on Sundays with no extra hiring personnel, or additional
            salary. The government is promoting  the
            privatization of pensions. It will be the markets and stock exchanges
            that determine whether and what pension you will  receive.  </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> <b>Attacks
            on Education</b> </p>
            <p> The
            government is passing a law to change the education system. The most
            important issue for ND is to set up a campus police division
            answerable to the police chief and Ministry of Citizen
            Protection . This is the first time a campus police force is
            being made. It will be staffed with the recruitment of 1,000 new
            officers, who will patrol the five main universities armed with
            clubs. All universities will be equipped with surveillance equipment.
            Institution check-in and student entry card will be necessary, this
            will limit entrance to universities to students, academic staff,
            employees and controlled visitors. This serves to smash leftist,
            anarchist and youth resistance that has historically begun on
            university campuses. Not to mention it will make it difficult for us
            to do our work. Under the proposed changes, university entrance
            requirements will also be amended, and time limits will be set for
            the completion of degree courses. All the education measures are part
            of implementing the EU Bologna accord which we have written about. We
            call for: <i><b>Police out of the Universities!</b></i>  
            </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> We
            are against the closing of   <i><b> all
            schools </b></i>  
            by
            the state. Universities have been shuttered for a year, yet police
            raided one of the main university dorms in Athens arresting five in
            December of last year.   
            Aiming to
            evacuate dormitories where students who have no place to go have
            continued to live despite the order to vacate. Before the closing of
            schools due to Covid the secondary schools across Greece were
            occupied by students in protest of the attacks on education.  
            </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p><b> The
            Working Class </b></p>
            <p> A
            national strike took place on November 26. The KKE called the strike
            in opposition to imposition of the 10-hour workday, against the
            uninsured and unpaid work. The KKE and all the left are opposed to
            work on Sunday. What they call the abolition of the Sunday holiday.
            Here most shops and stores are still closed on Sundays. Unlike the
            rest of the left we are not opposed to Sunday work which has its
            history also in the church (of course, with weekend shift premiums
            and transitional demands like 30 for 40). The strike was also in
            opposition to the privatization of pension funds and the
            confiscations, repossession and auctions of housing due to debt.   
            </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> A
            delegation of trade unionists from the Labor Center of Piraeus, as
            well as seafarers and other unions in the area, staged a protest at
            the ministry of shipping. Various workplaces also engaged in
            independent strikes. Small strikes took place despite the lockdown
            measures; some people were able to march in Athens despite the police
            bringing in anti-riot vehicles the night before. While the main march
            took place in Athens without incident, police attacked and arrested
            participants in a motorcycle protest organized by a newly organized
            delivery workers union. In other cities such as Ioannina, police
            attacked and arrested people participating in the strike. </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> Courier
            and food delivery workers have been especially under the gun. A lot
            of their ranks are made up of recently unemployed middle-aged
            workers. A courier with 20 years in a company was beaten up and his
            nose broken by his boss for not finishing all his deliveries for the
            day  .
            Under the table and uninsured work, intensification with 10 and 12
            hours of work, 6-7 day work are the norms. Workers are burdened with
            their own motorbike repairs and it is labor &quot;accidents&quot;
            that cost up to their own lives.   
            </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> <b>KKE
            prepares a Popular Front</b>  </p>
            <p> There
            are indications that KKE is preparing a Popular Front and we need to
            pay attention to this. In October of last year, the court ruled that
            Golden Dawn (fascist party) was a criminal organization and convicted
            its leadership to jail. That day a huge demonstration took place
            outside the court. It was the largest demo during Covid. All the left
            was present, as were bourgeoise parties i.e., PASOK and SYRIZA. Even
            the prime minister   of
            the right-wing party of ND said: &ldquo;Democracy won today.&rdquo;  </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> KKE
            participated in the same demo. Those who follow Greece know that for
            some decades now KKE does not demonstrate with the rest of the left.
            They typically organize their own separate demonstrations. It was
            interesting not only that they existed in the same space but
            especially that they had the same slogan: &ldquo;The people demand
            fascists in prison&rdquo;. The first part of the demand is the
            popular front, the second part is the faith in the capitalist state.
            The demo was a big liberal &ldquo;party&rdquo; for democracy and the
            slogans that they shared a first step towards a popular front!   
            </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> A
            month later, for the November 17 <sup>th </sup>
            demo which was declared illegal due to Covid, KKE under its own
            initiative asked SYRIZA and MERA25 (Varoufakis&rsquo; insignificant
            party) to co-sign a petition addressed to the President of the
            Republic, the Prime Minister and the political parties of parliament.  </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> It
            reads:  <i>&ldquo;We condemn the
            authoritarian decision of the government to ban the celebration of
            the 17</i> <sup><i>th</i> </sup><i>
            of November. The decision of the Chief of the Hellenic Police, which
            prohibits public gatherings of more than three people across the
            country and for four days, under the threat of strict fines, is
            reminiscent of other times. This is a deeply undemocratic and
            unconstitutional decision&hellip;&rdquo;</i>  </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> The
            decision of the Chief of Police stated  <i>&ldquo;Due
            to the urgent need to address a serious public health risk in the
            context of emergency measures to address the spread of Covid-19 &hellip;
            all public outdoor gatherings are prohibited throughout the country,
            in which 4 or more people participate, from 06:00 on November 15
            until 21:00 on November 18, 2020.&rdquo;</i>  </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> What
            is interesting is that this is  <i><b>the
            first </b></i> statement that KKE has done
            together with SYRIZA. KKE wanted all the &ldquo;progressive&rdquo;
            parties to participate but PASOK refused. This is an example of the
            fight the right politics now in play.  </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> Although
            it was under the initiative of KKE they present it differently from
            the rest. First, all newspapers published the statement on November
            15th. KKE&rsquo;s paper published it two days later. Second, all the
            bourgeoisie papers had a similar headline &ldquo;common statement
            between KKE &ndash; SYRIZA and MERA25&rdquo;. Rizospastis&rsquo;
            (KKE&rsquo;s paper) article on the 17 <sup>th </sup>:
            &ldquo; <i>Thousands of signatures gathered
            against the ban </i> [of the demo]&rdquo;
            and a subhead  <i>&ldquo;condemnation of the
            governmental autarchism&rdquo; </i> was
            buried in the paper <i>.</i> 
            In the article, they wrote with bold letters how all of KKE&rsquo;s
            MPs signed and have a small mention that the KKE leader called SYRIZA
            and MERA25 leaders to co-sign. They write against PASOK how
            unacceptable it is that they denied signing the petition and that
            PASOK does not support  &ldquo;this
            initiative against the undemocratic decision of the government.&rdquo;
            That is the only article in the KKE&rsquo;s press that has any
            mention of the common statement.   
            </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> SYRIZA
            has an article in its paper titled &ldquo; <i>why
            the common statement is a turning point</i> &rdquo;
            in which it says: &ldquo; <i>the progressive
            opposition parties rallied on a very simple issue: the defense of the
            Constitution&hellip; These parties have put aside their political,
            ideological and strategic disagreements and have made a common
            struggle against the upcoming totalitarianism&hellip;  The common
            text is a turning point for the political things in Greece. It shows
            the maturity of the parties that signed it, and also it shows their
            readiness to defend values.</i> &rdquo;
            [that means democracy and constitution]  </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p> KKE
            on the other hand made a different assessment. According to a
            statement by the CC issued on January 2020, they write: &ldquo; <i>In
            this decision we reacted immediately as a Party and took initiatives
            for mass condemnation by unions, associations, etc. At the same time,
            we have also taken the initiative to collect signatures to condemn
            this decision. This move was correct, facilitated our effort to make
            a mass condemnation of the government's decision and effectively go
            against the government's health care argument.</i> <i> This
            initiative to condemn the decision to ban </i><i>rallies</i> <i>
            was carried out by people from across the political spectrum, as well
            as by a decision of the </i><i>parties of SYRIZA
            ana MERA25</i> <i>, </i><i>while PASOK
            refused to participate. </i> 
            <p><i>It is certainly not the first or only time that on a particular issue there
            can be a common position of the Communist Party with other parties
            either in the Parliament, in local government bodies or in the
            movement.</i>  </p>
            <p>
            <i>The
            effort made and continues by forces of SYRIZA and opportunists with
            the related articles to give to this movement other dimensions is
            clear that it has nothing to do with reality. Any coincidence of KKE
            forces with other forces in the movement, in the unions, in the
            associations around objectives, demands, claims and mobilizations
            does not constitute any kind of &quot;united front&quot;&hellip;&rdquo;
            </i> In their conclusions they write: &ldquo; <i>This
            attitude was linked to the moods of a radical section of the workers
            </i> <i>and it also put pressure on the
            political base of other forces, in particular SYRIZA, which was
            expressed and on the fact that it finally supported the text of
            </i> <i>&shy;signatures</i> . &rdquo;  </p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p>
            It is the
            first time since the split with SYRIZA (then Synaspismos) that KKE
            has said: &ldquo; <i>on a particular issue
            there can be a common position of the Communist Party </i> <i><b>with
            other parties</b></i> <i> either in the
            Parliament, in local government bodies or in the movement.</i> &rdquo;
            It is interesting that KKE asked of their own personal &ldquo;nemesis&rdquo;
            SYRIZA to support their petition. Of course, KKE always blurs the
            difference between united and popular front. When they write that
            <i>SYRIZA and opportunist </i> organizations
            try to give other dimensions to this movement, they mainly refer to
            ANTARSYA (coalition of left parties and ecologists) who in a
            statement they published they accuse KKE of not doing enough.
            ANTARSYA writes that KKE is having a democratic front.  They complain
            that KKE does not provide a plan of actions, does not use the
            mobilization they achieved with the signatures to create a mass
            movement but only to support the developmental goals of KKE. No one
            from the left sees it as a popular front.

            <p> On
            November 17 2020 the right to demonstrate was banned for the first
            time since after the fall of the military junta in 1974. The state
            banned all gatherings of more than four people, even for purpose of
            exercise until November 18. Police occupied the city center with
            6,000 on the streets. They attacked demonstrations and imposed heavy
            fines on those arrested, fines totaling 23,000 euros at the
            Polytechnic alone. It is the first time in many years that the police
            have been able to attack the KKE&rsquo;s mobilization. A KKE MP was
            beaten and arrested. Other arrests included the president of the
            Union of the Attica hospital, lawyers involved in the lawsuit in the
            Golden Dawn trial as well as members of various left groups. Smaller
            protests took place in many Athens neighborhoods. Similar attacks
            took place in different cities around the country.

            <p> As
            Greece was slowly
            lifting strict COVID-19 restrictions during the first lockdown across
            the country, it has kept more than 120,000 asylum seekers in the
            lockdown, crammed in overcrowded camps.&nbsp;  
            On the island of Chios, refugees at the camp of Vial are virtually
            held captive. None of the 4,000 or so asylum seekers or refugees can
            exit for a walk, or go to the town&rsquo;s grocery store, and police
            are stationed on the surrounding roads. In tents and containers at
            camps across the country people must just sit and wait. Refugees
            spent summer under an ever-extending lockdown, as the Ministry of
            Migration or the camp managers announced every two weeks that the
            measures had been extended. This has impacted tens of thousands of
            refugees and are still in effect.&nbsp;Now with a cold front and snow
            refugees are packed in their squalid tents with a loss of electricity
            and frozen water. The new camp Kara Tepe replacing Moria camp has
            been in a virtual press lockout. No one knows what has happened to

            with less resistance and police are attacking every &ldquo;defiance&rdquo;
            and making illegal the gathering of 3 people and above, Mitsotakis
            makes appeals to the Church hierarchy. As a main, pro-ND paper
            Kathimerini wrote &ldquo; <i>Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos
            Mitsotakis urged the country's influential Orthodox Church on Tuesday
            to respect coronavirus restrictions during Epiphany celebrations on

            </i> The result was that  &ldquo; <i>Greek

            coronavirus restrictions that banned public gatherings&hellip;Police
            stood outside a number of churches but said they would not interfere

            The

            to  the influential Orthodox Church, which plays a central role
            in Greek life. In an article titled &ldquo;State&mdash;Church,
            war and peace&rdquo; there is a history of the relationships between
            the different governments and the church since 1981 and how the
            decisions made by the governments (mainly PASOK) to change things in
            the church drove ministers as well as the government to fall 
            (they fell from the grace of god!)
            for daring to propose some basic changes in the relationship between
            church and state.

            <p> SEK

            But that is not the case. The lockdown has served to atomize workers

            and met with intense repression. SEK also calls for the vaccinations
            to be under the control of the health workers:    &ldquo;The

            better salaries and so on. They try to pressure the state to do a
            better job and demand from the capitalist state to resolve the
            pandemic. The Secretary of KKE Koutsoubas said on an interview about

            The lockdown is the answer of
            the bourgeoisie and shows the complete irrationality under
            capitalism. It is to create a docile and disciplined workforce that
            will shut up, stay at home unless going to work and have nothing to
            enjoy in life. This began here before Covid with the smashing of
            smoking in restaurants and bars finally (It took years to implement
            this). We&rsquo;re in opposition to the ban on moving and night
            curfew. We had disagreements about the shutting of bars and
            restaurants that has driven thousands of people to lose their jobs.
            K.  and D. were 
            questioning if we should be in opposition on such a ban because of
            health reasons, in disagreement with J. that thought we should be
            against the ban. Finally, we came to an agreement against the ban but
            we definitely do need further discussion. The working people are not
            only in danger of losing their jobs and income but also they are
            under attack in every aspect of their lives e.g. their education,
            their everyday life, their pleasures, their socialization. </p>

            squares where people congregate, have a coffee, and generally
            socialize are now regularly monitored and sometimes attacked by the
            cops. The government has blamed the spread of covid mainly on youth.
            Many young people hangout in the open-air car-park of Lykavitos hill
            and neighbourhood squares. Due to the lockdown these are the few
            places they can go to socialize and drink. For teenagers these are
            places to get away from their parents. In Kypseli, an immigrant
            neighborhood of Athens the cops, part of a disbanded motorcycle unit,
            tore through the main square with tear gas. 37 people were detained
            and 5 were arrested.  2,000 protestors filled the square the
