            <u>Covid and
            (non-exceptional) capitalist government</u></p>
            <p class="spacer-1x"></p>
            <p>The
            Greek government has reacted to the Covid outbreak differently than
            other countries eg US, GB, Italy, Spain etch by taking measures very
            early on. The reason for that is not because it is an exceptional
            capitalist government who cares about the population but on the
            contrary because they know how weak is the health system of the
            country. Every country will act a bit different in a given crises but
            that does not change the role or the character of capitalism (eg more
            &ldquo;humane&rdquo;). There are some obvious differences among those
            countries: like the size of the country, the size and strength of
            each economy, the history of the country (eg see the number of
            dictatorships we had in the last 100 years in a country like Greece)
            as well as the component of class struggle.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Here the
            right-wing government of ND seeing also how the outbreak had
            developed in Italy took measures in advanced. Less than two weeks
            after the first COVID case in the country was confirmed they had
            closed all schools and had suspended all mass events. Few days after
            the initial measures, they also closed all nonessential shops and
            banned nonessential movement. By the time there was the first death
            from COVID almost all measures were already in place. Until today the
            number of deaths in Greece of COVID is as low as 108 people and the
            total number of infected (at least officially) is 2224 people. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In Greece ND
            knew how fragile and weak is the health system. It was them (as well
            as SYRIZA) that had shut down many hospitals and had banned the
            hiring of new doctors and nurses in an attempt EU dictates to lower
            the costs of public health. It is because of the economic crisis and
            austerity under the EU dictates that thousands of doctors left the
            country. If they had not acted as they did for COVID outbreak the
            political cost that they would have to face would be devastating for
            the party of ND but also it could create a more unstable situation
            for the Greek bourgeoisie.</p>
            <p>
            That of course
            does not mean that they acted in the interest of the working class,
            on the contrary they acted in the interest of the bourgeoisie in
            short and long turn. In the measures the government took was also 11
            million euros to the private tv channels in order to promote the
            works of the government and to under-report any problems from society
            and hospitals. They also gave 30 millions to private hospitals in
            order to be able to sub-rent intensive care units if and when needed
            and also to provide tests for Covid instead of allowing the public
            medical universities to provide the tests for all the population and
            most importantly free as they had proposed to the government that
            they can do.</p>

            <p>
            <u>National
            Unity and State Repression</u></p>
            <p>Since
            the beginning of the new measures for Covid police is on the streets
            by dozens, stopping people, searching, giving fines for unessential
            movement. In order to get out of your house if your work your
            employer needs to provide you with a paper saying your home address
            and the work address and the exact time of your work schedule, if you
            do not work  you need to either text the state or have a signed paper
            with you that says the reason you are on the streets (there are 6
            reasons that allows you to leave your house). Police
            even gave tickets to homeless because they were &ldquo;unnecessarily
            on the streets&rdquo;. It
            is not only covid that makes people feel unsafe, it is also the
            police state measures with the repression and harassment that looks
            like a &ldquo;general rehearsal&rdquo; for times to come. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Few days ago,
            Prime Minister in
            a televized address to the nation
            commended
            Greeks for adhering to the restrictive measures implemented over the
            past five weeks to stem of the spread of the coronavirus in the
            country.
            He
            said the biggest gain from the &ldquo;unprecedented crisis&rdquo;
            will be the trust towards the state
            (!),
            the government
            (!!)
            and the fellow citizen.
            At another point he added that today we are building &ldquo;a more
            powerful state&rdquo;. [When I heard him talking about the trust to
            the state and to the government, and the creation of a more powerful
            state I felt a shudder!]</p>
            <p>
            Some
            of what we hear every day from the government and read in the papers
            are:
            &quot;Our
            <i>collective
            destiny depends on our individual responsibility&quot;, &quot;Individual
            responsibility will judge the outcome of this battle&quot; </i>etch.
            The state, by citing individual responsibility as a key factor in the
            outcome of the epidemic, is trying to silence state responsibility
            and the incapability of capitalism. The present crisis is not just a
            health crisis but a capitalist crisis. The bourgeoisie &ndash; under
            the EU dictates - has been underfunding and understaffing for so many
            years, has closed public hospitals, has left a country of 10 million
            residents with 565<a href="#note1"  class="footnote-ref" id="ref1">[1]</a>
            ICU beds, fires health workers, now calls
            for a &quot;national unity&quot; to deal with the pandemic, a &quot;common
            conscription of all Greeks&quot;, in order to deal with the
            &quot;invisible enemy&quot;.
            As
            they say: in such circumstances we must &quot;avoid&quot;
            &quot;polarization&quot; and &quot;confrontation&quot;.

            ND government, say &quot;the COVID does not distinguish borders or
            nations, incomes or social groups. Against him, we are all equal&rdquo;.
            In the same line Alexis Tsipras (leader of SYRIZA) wrote in a recent
            article: &quot;What matters at this time is that we all fight
            together, united for life[...]
            now
            is the time of responsibility and not confrontation.&quot; Even if we
            accept that the first sentence of the prime minister was correct when
            he said that &quot;the COVID does not distinguish borders or nations,
            incomes or social groups&rdquo; but for sure the second sentence
            where he said &ldquo;Against it, we are all equal&rdquo; that is
            definitely <u>NOT
            TRUE</u>.
            If you have the means you also have faster and better medical
            attention, you have the money to ensure a ICU bed in a private
            hospital &ndash; because the public are not enough, you can pay 200
            euros to do the test whenever you want, you do not have to wait in
            unending lines in order to tell you if you can have the test or not
            etch. 
            </p>
            <p>
            A couple days
            ago they found positive in COVID some ROMA who live in a camp in an
            area in middle of Greece. According
            to an article from a pro-SYRIZA bourgeois newspaper on the housing
            situation of the Roma in Greece in a survey on 2018 there are 104.210
            Roma who live in 314 different areas in the country. From those more
            than 8.500 are living  &ldquo;in extreme conditions of
            impoverishment, with shacks instead of houses, with a complete
            shortage of basic goods such as water supply, electricity, sewerage
            system with rodents and accumulation of rubbish
            confirmed
            that the situation is out of control and there are serious risks to
            both the health of people living in the camps and public health in
            general.&rdquo; While the biggest proportion almost 60.000 of Roma
            are living in mixed camps, where houses and shacks coexist. Roma have
            always been an easy target for state repression not only here but all
            over Europe and they are at the bottom of society. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The only
            reason that the immigrants have not be blamed at least not initially
            for &ldquo;spreading the illness&rdquo; is because the first COVID
            patients in Greece was a bunch of Greeks that had just returned from
            the &ldquo;holy lands&rdquo; of Jerusalem. But they are used
            (immigrants) in order to increase the anti-Turkish chauvinism in
            combination with the &ldquo;national unity in times of need&rdquo;.
            [At the same time Greek nationalism against Turkey is used in order
            to increase the anti-immigrants&rsquo; sentiment]. The last few days
            there are repeated news reports that Erdogan is planning to send to
            the Greek islands boats full of immigrants&rsquo; who are infected
            with COVID.  As a bourgeois paper writes &ldquo;Greek
            authorities have found out that numerous migrants in Turkey have been
            concentrating in the country's western seaside towns, as if ready to
            cross into neighboring Greece's islands in the Aegean Sea.
            More worrying,
            sources that cannot be named but are considered reliable believe that
            Turkey has a plan to push migrants infected with the coronavirus to
            cross into Greece and other parts of Europe in the midst of the virus
            pandemic.&rdquo;
            Immigrants are trapped by thousands in camps under terrible
            conditions, with limited access if any at all to medical treatment,
            with very limited access to water and with no health measures what so
            ever.   &nbsp;
                
            </p>
            <p>
            Of
            course, in all this &ldquo;emergency situation&rdquo; the parliament
            has been able to pass &ndash; or plans to pass in the next days - at
            least a dozen new laws under &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; procedures that
            have to do from changes in education to immigration policy, prison
            rights, working rights etch.  
            </p>
            <p>
            On&nbsp;April
            7,
            on the occasion of&nbsp; World Health Day, mobilizations
            took place all over Greece, in the gates and in the courtyards of
            hospitals.
            The
            mobilizations were initiated by the Federation of Doctors'
            Associations in Hospitals, demanding the immediate adoption of
            measures to substantially strengthen public health, to protect the
            people
            and the workers.
            In
            one of the mobilizations, which took place at the &quot;Evangelismos&quot;
            Hospital (Athens)
            the
            government sent strong police forces to the hospital's courtyard,
            seeking to disperse the rally, under the pretext of &quot;banning
            rallies of more than 10 people&quot;. Eventually the police forces
            withdrew under the reaction of the workers
            (nurses and doctors who were shouting to them to get out).
            They didn&rsquo;t want to provoke the public opinion by arresting or
            attacking to the doctors who up to that day were portraited by the
            government as the everyday &ldquo;heroes&rdquo;. In doing so
            (repressing them) the political cost would be too big.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Another thing
            that has happened the period of isolation is increase in domestic
            violence towards women and also children. At the same time and from
            day one when schools closed women had to either stop working or work
            from home in order to be able to take care of the children. Also,
            because the elderly is in more danger, they have to take care the
            parents and the grandparents. The burden of the Covid crisis under
            capitalism has hit them harder and the moto is &ldquo;back to the
            family&rdquo;.</p>
            <p>
            A couple weeks
            ago there was a riot in woman&rsquo;s prison asking for better
            conditions after the death of an imprisoned women who in the
            beginning though that she had died because of Covid. The reaction of
            the state was to send riot police and beat the hell out of them
            sending two Roma women to the hospital. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <u>KKE</u></p>
            <p>The
            Stalinist KKE although it has a lot of articles in defense of the
            working class (like working conditions, protection measures under the
            pandemic, mobilizations [very small because of the situation] etch),
            at the same time they demand from the government to &ldquo;confiscate
            the private hospitals&rdquo;. Even more grotesque they spread
            illusions to the capitalist system that it can be pressured to act in
            the interest of the working class and the oppressed. KKE writes &ldquo;the
            government and the bosses are using the slogan &lsquo;all together we
            will overcome the crisis&rsquo; and by that want us silenced which is
            nothing more than hypocrisy and bourgeoisie morality. Because we
            can&rsquo;t all together do health
            recruitments,
            to
            confiscate the private sector, to take prevention and protection
            measures. This, <i><b>under
            this system, must be done by the government and the state</b></i>,
            together
            with the class that has the real power and ownership.
            And that's until the working class, the people &lsquo;all
            together,&rsquo;
            united, to put them aside permanently and irrevocably and build a
            society where
            social goods will be the priority, as opposed to the capitalist
            profit that leads to the death of our fellow human beings.&ldquo;
            (our emphasis)</p>
            <p>
            Interesting
            enough although they have the position that China is imperialist in
            an attempt to justify China&rsquo;s different reaction on the
            pandemic they write &ldquo;even
            the
            management of
            the
            pandemic in capitalist
            China reveals its socialist
            remnants and shows that
            socialism
            has left still
            three decades
            after
            its
            overturning a strong social
            footprint&rdquo;</p>
            <p>
            On
            EU although KKE blames them for all the evil on the world their
            demand is for &ldquo;disengagement from the EU with the working class
            in power&rdquo;. For whoever did not understand it mean that we must
            leave the EU when the working class will first have taken the power
            in an abstract future.  
            </p>
            <p>
            KKE
            in accordance to the terrible position it has on the state, they
            defend the police and even had a question on the parliament on what
            measures does the government takes in order to protect them in the
            pandemic so they can be able to do their jobs.

            <u>European
            Union</u></p>
            <p>What
            we achieved with our fights before and during the Plenum has proven
            its validity under the Covid outbreak. Although the lessons of the
            Plenum have not yet been realized by all (tried to hide the Plenum in
            Spartacist) our position was valid on the illusions of the EU as a
            super-state with common borders and a &ldquo;human&rdquo; face. It is
            very important for all our sections to publish powerful propaganda
            against the EU and expose our opponents for their support to the EU. 
            </p>
            <p>
            EU has shown
            how unstable it is during the crisis of COVID: When Italy asked for
            help Germany denied. It was Cuba who sent them doctors and nurses to
            assist them. When Greece orders medical supplies from China they were
            stopped and confiscated in a German airport. After Spain and Italy
            asked for financial help it took three days of &ldquo;discussions&rdquo;
            in order for the main imperialist powers of EU (mainly Germany) to
            come up with a plan of new memorandums. According
            to the IMF unemployment for Greece will be 22.3% while the recession
            can be up to 13% (the recession during the economic crisis in 2012
            was 7.3%).
            The new memorandum &ndash; that for sure will come - will lead to
            more attacks to the unions and the workers&rsquo; rights. In Greece
            with the huge petty-bourgeoisie (mainly small family owned shops) the
            outcome after Covid will be even more devastating. In
            the epoch after Covid we will probably face also the possibility that
            fascists and right-wing forces will grow. That can be true not only
            for Greece.

            At the same
            time all through EU national antagonisms between states is
            increasing. Borders are shut down for people but not for workers
            exploitation (see what happened with Germany and Romanian land
            workers). Every bourgeoisie of Europe has been over occupied with
            concerns for its own country, its own health system, its own citizens
            [in the degree that they give a shit], its own supplies etch.
            Nationalism is increasing and that will also increase the
            anti-immigrant sentiments in Europe and elsewhere.</p>

            <u>Church and
            State</u></p>
            <p>Not
            surprisingly the only measure that was implemented not by direct
            governmental order but only after days of discussions and begging and
            only after an agreement, was the closing of the churches. As the
            church announced: &ldquo;The
            Holy Synod, the ruling body of Greece&rsquo;s Orthodox Church, agreed
            to suspend all daily services and sacraments for an indefinite period
            as part of the government&rsquo;s efforts to contain the spread of
            the new coronavirus.&rdquo;
            But even after the &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; we have seen many
            occasions that priests have open the churches to the believers
            especially this week which is the Greek orthodox Easter. Priests were
            insisting &ndash; and still are &ndash; that no harm can come to the
            believers that participate in the holy communion because &ldquo;no
            disease can be carried through the blood and body of Crist&rdquo;.
            Holy communion in Orthodox Church is given through one spoon and one
            cup to all those who participate (just to be clear: <i><b>one
            and the same</b></i>
            cup and spoon for all). Just yesterday police made 13 arrests outside
            a church were dozens of &ldquo;believers&rdquo; were gathered. Many
            people of those &ldquo;believers&rdquo; were members of Golden Dawn.
            In many more occasions that churches were &ldquo;illegally&rdquo;
            opened there were only recommendations from the government or the
            police showing once more the power that the church has upon the Greek
            state.

            <p>In
            the country the measures have worked until now but that is because
            people stayed home and not because the government is doing something
            to protect the people. At the same time the participation of hundreds
            of voluntaries is just covering the gaps and are used in order not to
            do the necessarily hiring.

            Even
            here in Greece with all its debt they tried to buy off the
            population. What they offered is 800 euros for every business is in
            lock-down (it is for a total of 750.000 employs) and a voucher of 600
            euros in online education for those who are self-employed and have
            lost or reduced their income (like me [it is for a number of 85.000
            self employs]) as well as 400 euros for 155.000 unemployed. Even that
            is not per month but it supposed to cover the losses for March and
            April.</p>
            <p>
            A
            real fear remains for the time after the &ldquo;corona virus period&rdquo;:
            how many of the &ldquo;necessary measures&rdquo; will still remain.
            That&rsquo;s the fear for thousands of workers that have been sent
            home during the crisis, who work from home or work with less hours
            and with less pay, who lost their jobs and so on.
