            <h1>Why the degeneration of the ICL</h1>
            <p>
            	The defense of Spartacist
            principles and programs can only be developed by examining not only
            the errors that have punctuated the history of the IST/ICL, but,
            above all, by trying to trace back to their causes and how they
            could -- or should -- have been avoided. Trotsky, in assessing the defeat in
            China in 1925-27, remarked:</p>
                <div class="citation">
            &quot;We are entering in China
            into a period of reflux, and consequently into a period in which the
            party deepens its theoretical roots, educates itself critically,
            creates and strengthens firm organizational links in all spheres of
            the working class movement, organizes rural nuclei, leads and unites
            partial, at first defensive and later offensive, battles of the workers and the
            peasant poor.&quot; 
            </div>
            <div class="source">
            	--
            &quot;<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1928/3rd/ti09.htm#p3-03">The Third International After
            Lenin</a>&quot;
        </div>
            <p>
            	Such
            a deepening of theoretical roots
            and critical self-education had been envisioned by the ICL, but they
            were at best superficial, if not just false. The ICL was already too
            demoralized to seriously undertake such a task. It is this very task
            that we now seek to outline.</p>
            <p>
            	We consider it our duty
            to attempt to provide some clues toward understanding the blatant failure of
            the IST/ICL, while
            being fully aware that we hold no monopoly on truth and we make no claim 
            to have any definitive answers.
            If we consider that Spartacism was the continuation of Canonism and
            Trotskyism, its programmatic disappearance would represent a
            considerable loss for the international proletariat. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>The final turning point of 2017</h2></p>
            <p>
            	The ICL's definitive political
            shift came with the adoption of a nationalist line at the 
            <a href="https://old.iclfi.org/english/esp/65/hydra.html">2017
            conference</a>.
            <a href="../../c/e/docs/doc-c-e-001.html#doc-c-e-001">Our 
            first document</a>, distributed at the LO festival in 2023, exposed
            all the falsifications, distortions, and other forms of cheating the
            young Quebec nationalists had engaged in, under the imprimatur of
            Coelho, the then secretary of the International secretariat (IS). We
            also briefly explained how these young Quebecers were used by Coelho
            for his own purposes (which were to get rid of the &quot;Old Ones&quot;),
            thinking she could then have her hands free. This was a bad plan, since
            she herself would be abruptly and unceremoniously dismissed from her
            position a few months later (she has since received a favor in
            return).</p>
            <p>
            	This conference had begun to
            highlight a key problem for the IST/ICL: its historical
            US-centricity. But this was deflected by nationalists into
            &quot;anglo-chauvinism,&quot; reducing everything to national issues
            (&quot;the Hydra&quot;). Now, it is clear that for a very long time,
            the US section of the IST/ICL dominated the international
            organization at all levels (starting financially), a domination that
            could never be challenged and which even grew stronger as
            demoralization and aging set in.</p>
            <p>
            	How could such grotesque and
            ridiculous events of 2017 have occurred? Because all the cadres of
            this organization (including us) were (and are, for those who
            remained) completely demoralized. The 26 years following the
            destruction of the USSR clearly show the elements of an organization
            that was thinking less and less and following the line established in
            the &quot;center&quot; (through the standard-bearer <i>WV</i>),
            still composed mainly of SLUS leaders and based in the United States,
            a center that would systematically buckle before its own imperialism.</p>
            <p>
            	The most emblematic example is,
            of course, <a href="https://old.iclfi.org/english/wv/951/haiti.html">the 
            capitulation of the SLUS to US imperialism in Haiti</a>
            in 2010. After arguing in <i>WV</i>
            that the imperialist army could save the Haitians, all sections of
            the ICL, without exception, followed suit. Absolutely no one in the
            entire organization at the international level found anything to
            complain about. Then, under pressure from external criticism, when
            after several weeks Robertson indicated that there was &quot;a
            problem,&quot; as one man, the entire organization would do a 180&deg;
            turn simply by reading the IS text announcing the &quot;error.&quot;
            The International executive 
            committee's <a href="https://old.iclfi.org/english/leaflets/rehaiti.html">Statement 
            repudiating</a> the position simply falls back on the isolation and aging of the SLUS (and the
            ICL) as an explanation for the capitulation of its flagship section,
            the section at the heart of US imperialism. And to cross its fingers that
            it does not happen again. The problem is that 2010 was 
            <a href="../../e/docs/doc-e-001-005.html#capitul1">neither the
            first time it gave in</a> to US imperialism, nor the last.</p>
            <p>
            	We will also return to the
            early 1980s, &quot;the Reagan years&quot;, a Reagan who was
            considered, and the rereading of the <i>WV</i>
            of the time is explicit, as<a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/workersvanguard/1982/0307_11_06_1982.pdf"

            attributed the responsibility essentially to Robertson's bureaucratic
            regime, a regime that would have begun to degenerate in the 1970s.
            While there were clearly bureaucratic problems (we have no definitive
            explanation, for the time being, regarding the settling of scores 
            among the youth or the holding of the 
            <a href="https://bolshevik.org/statements/ibt_20240903_spartacists_adrift_revolutionary_leadership_permanent_revolution.html"

            trial/spectacle in <a href="https://bolsheviktendency.org/2021/08/10/on-the-logan-show-trial/">1979</a>), 
            we believe there are other explanations, such as the end of the IST's
            very limited expansion &mdash; with the change of period linked to
            the end of the post-1968 wave or the Vietnam War &mdash;, a
            misunderstanding of US imperialism, or the maintenance of a
            US-centricity in the IST.</p>
            <p>
            	This profound demoralization
            was compounded by the destruction of the USSR. Re-examining all these
            periods, critically, is fundamental.</p>
            <h2>The roots of the demoralization of the IST/ICL</h2>
            <p>
            	To understand how the
            destruction of the USSR could have such an impact on the IST/ICL, it
            will be necessary to revisit the key stages. And while it is clear to
            us that the IST's
            positions on the events that unfolded in Poland in 1980-1981 were
            entirely correct, it is patently obvious
            that the rise to power of Gorbachev's team in the USSR changed the
            game for the IST.
            It slowly slid from acknowledging reality to denying it (in the USSR,
            the GDR, and the other deformed workers' states of Eastern Europe).</p>
            <h3>From Solidarno&#347;&#263; 1981 to Gorbachev</h3>
            <p>
            While it had been able to
            correctly analyze the events in Poland (the reactionary nature of
            Solidarno&#347;&#263;, the very low level
            of consciousness of the Polish working class that led it to follow
            the reactionary clerical-nationalists, the goals of the polish
            bureaucracy, etc.), the IST was unable to recognize a situation that
            was identical in other workers' states (degenerated and deformed).
            Workers' consciousness and combativeness were at the same disastrous
            level as in Poland (or even worse), and a rereading of 
            <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/workersvanguard/index.htm"><i>WV</i>'s
            </a>articles from the period (1985-1988) amply demonstrates this. Faced
            with the dangers that Gorbachevism represented (by opening the door
            to capitalist restoration), the IST simply tried to reassure itself
            month after month by pretending that the working class was ready to
            defend the gains of the degenerated workers' state, which implied a
            high level of combativeness and consciousness among the working
            class. But, upon careful rereading of the dozens of published
            articles, we find only 
            <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/spartacist-us/1988-1993/0041-0042_Winter_1989-88.pdf"
            class="instant-tooltip" data-tooltip="see page 14">a 
            tiny strike of drivers</a> 
            in a bus depot lost in the Moscow suburbs. The only real movement of
            the working class was 
            <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/workersvanguard/1989/0482_21_07_1989.pdf">the 
            massive miners' strike</a> in Kuzbass and Donbass in early 1989. As <i>WV</i>
            has well documented (and as can be found today in all analyses), the
            Gorbachev bureaucracy immediately complied with the demands of the
            strike committees (demands that were otherwise purely economic &mdash; and
            justified) &mdash; in order to ensure social peace and prevent the situation
            from leading to a reawakening of the working class throughout the
            USSR.</p>
            <p>
            	Using the Cou&eacute; method,
            the IST leadership thus asserted, article after article, that the
            working class was ready to defend its gains, even ready to move
            towards political revolution, although
            providing no evidence to suggest such an outcome.
            The major difference between Poland in 1981 and the Gorbachev era,
            which explains this denial of reality, is this: in Poland,
            it was clear that the Polish bureaucracy, with the full and total
            support of the Soviet bureaucracy, was not going to let the
            counter-revolution win and was going to strike hard, whereas under
            Gorbachev, nothing suggested that he intended to bring the
            counter-revolution to a brutal halt. On the contrary, the prospect of
            a counter-revolution in the USSR and the Eastern bloc countries was,
            unfortunately, becoming a real threat. The IST, instead of
            recognizing this danger, preparing for it, and preparing the sectors
            of the working class who, where the IST was present, that is, in the
            West, were seeking to prevent the catastrophe (essentially the
            Stalinists), took refuge in its dreams.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>The IST confused desire and reality in the DDR&hellip;</h3></p>
            <p>
            	It should also not be forgotten
            that throughout the early 1980s and until very late
            (<a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/workersvanguard/1987/0432_10_07_1987.pdf">1987</a>),
            the SLUS (and therefore the IST) considered that in the arms race
            with the USSR, the USA would be the one to lose. We will return to
            this point, which helps explain in part why the IST was caught off
            guard by the events in Eastern Europe and the DDR in 1989 (for
            example, the German section of the IST, which had never set foot in
            the DDR with an international leadership of the IST that had never
            instructed it to do so). Not only was this an important task (if only
            to take the pulse of Gorbachevism and, from the outside, get some
            sense of what was happening), but it was also a relatively easy one
            to carry out. A reflection of the IST&rsquo;s view that a crisis was
            more likely in the West than in the East.</p>
            <p>
            	As a result, when events
            unfolded, completely unexpectedly for the IST, everything was hastily
            improvised, both politically and organizationally. It was a general
            mobilization, which was normal given the historical importance of
            these events. But the main problem was that this general mobilization
            was based on the confusion between an absolute necessity &mdash; the
            proletarian political revolution &mdash; and reality. In the months
            preceding the events, it was
            <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/workersvanguard/1989/0484_01_09_1989.pdf">nationalist 
            eruptions</a> or the flight of the petty bourgeoisie that had made the headlines, not
            strikes, demonstrations, or workers' mobilizations. The IST had
            absolutely no militants in the DDR. And since Poland in 1981,
            everything that was happening in Eastern Europe or the USSR in no way
            heralded political revolutions. Under these conditions, immediately
            announcing, as the IST did, that the 
            <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/workersvanguard/1989/0492_29_12_1989.pdf">political 
            revolution</a> had begun and acting as if the working class was beginning to build a
            dual power could only destabilize the IST.</p>
            <p>
            	Of course,
            if the proletarian revolution had been underway, a tiny organization
            like the ICL could have intersected a part of the workers' vanguard.
            But the reality was very different. The most striking thing (and a reading of
            the ICL's propaganda and press from that period amply demonstrates
            this) is the passivity and lack of mobilization of the working class.
            Both in the DDR (the height of the ICL's intervention) and in the
            USSR. However, the 
            <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/tp/tp-text.htm#mt">transitional 
            program</a> that revolutionaries must advance for a working class building
            soviets and dual power has nothing to do with the transitional
            program that addresses a completely passive working class, especially
            when it faces a historic attack on the world's first workers' state.</p>
            <p>
            	Looking at the intervention of
            the IST/ICL in the DDR as reported in its press, or summarized in
            anniversary articles, it is clear that the Spartakist workers' groups
            are extremely small in number, without any real influence, and that
            the soldiers' councils, which were slightly more numerous, were
            almost immediately dismantled by the bureaucracy. All that remains is
            the <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/workersvanguard/1990/0493_12_01_1990.pdf">Treptower 
            Park</a> demonstration for which a part of the working class turned out, but,
            as the ICL press also shows, the Soviet bureaucracy (since the East
            German bureaucracy had completely exploded) took care to close the
            doors to any risk, however minimal, of &quot;slippage&quot; by
            accelerating the process which would lead to the counter-revolution.</p>
            <p>
            	If the East German working
            class and soldiers had been truly mobilized and politically ready
            to defend their deformed workers' state, the ICL might have had a
            somewhat larger impact, but this was not the case. The ICL's program
            did not allow the few dozen soldiers or workers who listened to it
            and acted with it to intervene properly among their colleagues. It
            considered the workers and soldiers as already aware that the DDR had
            to be defended, whereas the central problem was that they had to be
            convinced of the vital necessity of this
            defense of the DDR, and that they alone could do it.</p>
            <p>
            	For revolutionaries, confusing desire with reality is fatal.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>... as in the USSR</h3></p>
            <p>
            	We find exactly the same flaws
            in the ICL's intervention regarding the USSR. Even worse, since it
            takes place <i><b>after</b></i>
            the defeat in the DDR. The most staggering from this point of view is
            probably Seymour's presentation in

            which was, for several years, the spartacist &quot;bible&quot; on the
            counter-revolution in the USSR and the Eastern bloc. This text is
            dated October 10, 1990, so <i><b>after
            the defeat in the DDR</b></i>
            and while events were underway in the USSR. After an overview of the
            Eastern Workers' Democracies, for which he reviews the various
            bureaucratic cliques -- because he has absolutely no workers'
            mobilization to get his teeth into -- Seymour ends with the USSR. It
            seems that his only objective is to reassure himself and the ICL: &quot;<i>it
            is difficult to envision the capitalist-restorationist forces
            achieving governmental power short of civil war, as has occurred in
            East Europe.</i>&quot; A mere assertion to make people hope things will be 
            different from the DDR. Seymour (and the SLUS/ICL leadership) explains 
            that &quot;<i>All evidence indicates that the mass of Soviet workers do not support the
            establishment of a capitalist market economy</i> as
            such.&quot; Which is probably true. But the real problems, as was the
            case in the DDR, are the passivity of the working class and its level
            of consciousness, problems he does not address. Furthermore, to think
            that the creation of a trotskyist group at the last moment, since<i><b>
            it did not exist</b></i> at the time Seymour
            wrote his text, could run counter to what he considers a
            &quot;bipolarization&quot; of Soviet society is preposterous.</p>
            <p>
            	The problem is not to consider that intervening would be pointless,
            of course, but to understand that the role of a mere handful of
            militants arriving at the very last moment, from the outside, not all
            of whom speak Russian, facing a completely passive working class (at
            best), can only be very limited and targeted. As in DDR, if the
            working class is not convinced of the need to defend the workers'
            state and aware that it alone has the power to do so (with the
            intervention of a revolutionary party), there can be no mass
            mobilizations of the working class. This is what Seymour describes,
            and what the facts have proven.
            Faced with a working class that has no clear class consciousness and is not
            engaged in mass mobilizations, revolutionnaris will not be able 
            <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1935/11/stalin.htm">to 
            turn the wheel of history in the opposite direction</a>.
            This simple observation is neither a challenge to the necessity of the party, nor to
            historical pessimism, nor a rewriting of history after the fact. It
            is the understanding that the program and tasks of revolutionaries
            stem from reality as it is, not from a fantasized reality. Otherwise,
            it is to delude oneself and guaranteeing rude awakenings in the
            future. This is what happened to the ICL. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>The incorrect assessment of the events by the ICL in the DDR and the USSR&hellip;</h3></p>
            <p>
            	The balance sheet drawn up by
            the ICL of the destruction of the USSR was disastrous. It never
            questioned, at any point, the program or form of its intervention.
            Although they are scattered and spread out, all the arguments mentioned above
            can nevertheless be found above, which indicate the
            ICL was rather off the mark. But questioning the content and
            perspectives of this intervention was subject to an avalanche of
            insults and tensions (demonstrating that there was indeed a problem).</p>
            <p>
            	The texts and discussions
            following the end of the DDR or the USSR are damning. While it is
            clearly stated on several occasions that the proletariat, both in the
            DDR and in the USSR, did not mobilize, and it is recognized (briefly)
            that the level of consciousness was very low, nothing is said about
            the programs or actions of the ICL, which were based on a presumed
            high level of consciousness and a possible worker mobilization. 
            <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/spartacist-us/1988-1993/0045-0046_Winter_1990-91.pdf">The
            texts of Seymour and St-John</a> from September-October 1990 lamentably try to explain that the
            consciousness of soviet workers would not be the same as that of the
            deformed workers' state in the DDR because there was a proletarian
            revolution in 1917. &quot;<i>It
            is difficult to envision the capitalist-restorationist forces
            achieving governmental power short of civil war, as has occurred in
            East Europe</i>&quot;
            asserts Seymour. It is clear that the ICL leadership sought by every
            means to cling to the hope of a proletarian political revolution.
            With the consequence that this could only disorient the ICL's meager
            forces.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>&hellip;leads to equally incorrect perspectives</h3></p>
            <p>
            	A much more serious problem is
            that for more than 25 years, the ICL never truly grasped the full
            consequences of what the destruction of the USSR had set in motion.</p>
            <p>
            	The texts, whether those from
            the period leading up to the destruction of the DDR and then that of
            the USSR, or those assessing the situation, all primarily seek to
            reassure and ease the minds of the militants of the ICL by promising
            them that the destruction of the workers' states would open up
            perspectives. 
            <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/spartacist-us/1988-1993/0045-0046_Winter_1990-91.pdf">Al 
            Nelson</a> explained in september 1990 that &quot;<i>the
            present situation opens up unprecedented opportunities for our
            programmatic tendency</i>.&quot;
            Then <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/spartacist-us/1988-1993/0047-0048_Winter_1992-93.pdf">the
            text voted on at the 1992 ICL conference</a> (which briefly acknowledges that the USSR had been destroyed)
            predicts a favorable situation because the so-called Trotskyist
            opponents are disoriented and the Stalinist parties are exploding. At
            no point are the disastrous consequences addressed (massive
            demoralization of the workers, arrogance of the imperialist
            bourgeoisies, etc.) that such a defeat was going to bring about.</p>
            <p>
            	In 1990, Al Nelson (using
            Robertson's formulations) reports a debate in which comrades believed
            that ICL militants were politically disarmed. In his refutation of
            this point, there is another passage that helps us understand the
            state of confusion in which the ICL leadership found itself: &quot;<i>This
            period is not equivalent to, say, 1928 in China, where. Trotsky could
            find no satisfaction in the fact that his analysis was proven
            correct. Temporary confusion and demoralization of sections</i></p>
            <p>
            <i>of the proletariat is not the
            same thing as being smashed and atomized by bloody defeats.</i>&quot;
            Even though the defeat in China had important consequences for the
            Chinese proletariat, comparing it with the destruction of the USSR is
            more than problematic. And the word &quot;temporary&quot; clearly
            shows that the objective is to make comrades
            believe that this is just a bad moment that will soon pass.
            In the years that follow, ICL militants
            will be desperately searching for these &quot;unprecedented
            opportunities.&quot;</p>
            <p>
            <h3>The ICL torn apart</h3></p>
            <p>
            	With these opportunities
            nowhere to be found, the discrepancy and contradictions between the
            decided perspectives and the reality of the world and of the working
            class will inevitably lead ICL militants to search for programmatic
            shortcuts to find these &quot;opportunities.&quot; These shortcuts
            were certainly fought against on a case-by-case basis whenever their
            disastrous consequences became apparent, but since the causes were
            not and never had been identified, they were recurrent. And this
            phenomenon was very rapid, as revealed by the 1996 CEI memorandum. In
            line with previous conferences, it lists a long series of dazzling
            openings and recruitment opportunities for the ICL throughout the
            world. Then it denounces Norden, who, as head of the labor IS in
            Germany, tried to reconcile former DDR
            bureaucrats and transformed simple defensive struggles into offensive
            ones (he thus fabricated opportunities). Norden will
            persist in and consolidate this line of transforming reality.
            The IS established at this conference was not able to respond to
            him. Since the responsibility for these capitulations was not
            attributed to the contradictions of the ICL's policy, it was shifted
            onto Norden, whom the IS would eventually exclude bureaucratically.</p>
            <p>
            	Two things can be noted about
            this 1996 plenum. The most important is that the collision between
            the ICL's policy and the reality of the world is violent enough to be
            reflected in the memorandum. The IEC quotes, at the beginning, the
            first paragraph of Trotsky's &quot;Stalinism and Bolshevism,&quot;
            which is the <a href="b-1.html#pourquoi1">epigraph</a> 
            to &quot;Why this blog&quot;.
            The IEC even feels obliged to recognize a downward shift in
            consciousness among the working classes. Unfortunately, as we saw
            above, these statements have no consequences either in terms of
            central perspectives or in programmatic terms. They are only
            secondary formulas. The ICL leadership and its militants consider the
            dazzling perspectives to be much more important. The other point is
            that in this battle against Norden over the former DDR stalinists,
            the ICL will solidify itself on the line that 
            &quot;<a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/workersvanguard/2000/0731_10_03_2000.pdf">the 
            ICL had given a revolutionary direction in DDR</a>&quot;
            (we will come back to this). Beyond the ridiculousness of this
            formulation, this line made it possible to avoid any challenge or
            questioning of the ICL's policy and intervention in the events in the
            DDR and the USSR. However, any attempt at political clarification
            regarding the ICL's drift must inevitably pass through this stage,
            which is a major turning point for the ICL.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Towards the final degeneration of the ICL</h3></p>
            <p>
            	With the working class
            retreating further and further and the ICL desperately clinging to
            its perspectives, the contradictions are set to reach a crescendo. As
            ICL militants saw nothing materialize, year after year, the quest for
            programmatic shortcuts and the wave of capitulations are also set to
            reach a crescendo. Just like the slow, creeping, and inexorable
            demoralization. With the ICL and the IS being under the stranglehold
            control of the SLUS, US based, it will be above all capitulations to the
            Democrats that will punctuate the ICL's &quot;debates.&quot; The
            secretaries (all U.S. nationals) will run themselves ragged (and get
            unceremoniously dumped) until they are completely burned out.
            The reason the secretary in charge during the crash in Haiti in
            2010 managed to escape unscathed (remain in her position) was
            that there were no longer any volunteers to take her place.</p>
            <p>
            	She thought she could put an end to the repeated crises and the
            widespread demoralization/passivity in the SLUS/ICL by ejecting the
            entire layer of &quot;Old Guards&quot; when the opportunity arose in
            2017 with the battle leading to the ICL's nationalist shift. She
            thought she could then consolidate a team of loyal (permanent)
            companions around her and then change the ICL's policy with her own.
            When the opportunity arose with the COVID crisis, her attempt to
            implement her (entirely economist) policy within the ICL ran its
            course. The young wolves she had brought into the international
            leadership had grown up and disagreed with this shift (or pretended
            to, when we see today that they are advancing exactly the same kind
            of program): they brought her down. And it wasn't to question a part
            of trotskyism, but trotskyism in its entirety (transitional program,
            permanent revolution, Russian question, communist work in the unions,
            etc.).</p>
