                <div class="citation"><i>Reactionary epochs like ours not only disintegrate and weaken the working class
            and isolate its vanguard but also lower the general ideological level
            of the movement and throw political thinking back to stages long
            since passed through. In these conditions the task of the vanguard
            is, above all, not to let itself be carried along by the backward
            flow: it must swim against the current. If an unfavourable relation
            of forces prevents it from holding political positions it has won, it
            must at least retain its ideological positions, because in them is
            expressed the dearly paid experience of the past. Fools will consider
            this policy &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo;. Actually it is the only means of
            preparing for a new tremendous surge forward with the coming
            historical tide.</i></div>

            <p>
            	The existence of the RT/TSI/ICL has spanned several historical periods.
            Born out of the nature of the Cuban Revolution, and standing out
            through its support for the defeat of US imperialism in Vietnam, the
            SLUS/TSI was later at its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzLWJIEUng">post</a>
            to defend the USSR against the
            imperialists during the second Cold War launched by Carter and
            Reagan. This represented a turning point which, unfortunately, ended
            with the destruction of the USSR (and all the deformed workers'
            states of Eastern Europe). This historic defeat of the world working
            class opened a new historical period in which we still find
            ourselves, the post-Soviet period, which proved fatal to the ICL.</p>
            <p>
            	Fatal for
            three main reasons: the ICL/IST was not politically and
            organizationally prepared for the destruction of the USSR; the
            conclusions its drew from it never sought to understand how its
            intervention was completely out of step with the reality of the
            working classes (in East Germany/DDR, the USSR, and elsewhere) and
            how its program could not and did not have any influence on events;
            the outlook of the ICL leadership after the destruction of the USSR
            never anticipated nor considered the disastrous consequences of this
            terrible defeat. We will therefore examine these crucial periods that
            fueled and led to the demoralization that made possible the ICL's
            final degeneration.</p>
            
            <p> <h2>The Consequences of the Destruction of the USSR </h2></p>
            </p>
            <p>
            	The end of
            the USSR put an end to the anti-Soviet &quot;front&quot; of the
            imperialist countries, and interimperialist rivalries were able to
            rekindle. However, the US hegemony was never threatened, as it
            scrupulously ensured, thanks to its power&mdash;economic and
            military&mdash;, that potential rivals were weakened as soon as they
            gained strength. 
            </p>
            
            <p> <h3>The
            setbacks of the organized labor movement</h3></p>
            <p>
            	One of the
            consequences of these rivalries was that each of the imperialists
            redoubled its attacks on the labor movement, starting with historical
            gains, in order to be more competitive than its rival. They were able
            to carry out all these attacks with the complicity of the reformist
            leaderships of the workers' movement since these, &quot;in the face
            of competition,&quot; rallied to the interests of their own
            bourgeoisies and supported them (and still support them) in the name
            of defending &quot;the nation&quot; or &quot;the enterprise.&quot;
            These <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/pref02.htm">&quot;labor
            lieutenants of the capitalist class&quot;</a> in
            order to preserve the few crumbs the imperialists distribute to them
            in exchange for their loyal service, have managed to divert,
            sabotage, or exhaust the resistance and struggles of the workers.
            Successful in their attacks, the capitalists have caused a decline in
            living standards, working conditions, health, education, and so on of
            the working-class. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	For they
            gradually cut back on everything they could in order to be more
            efficient than their competitors. In this race for profits, each
            setback achieved by one imperialist power forces its competitors not
            only to follow suit but also to prepare a new offensive leading to
            yet another retreat &mdash; a never-ending downward spiral for the
            workers. For three decades, we have witnessed an explosion in
            subcontracting, temporary work, outsourcing, and attempts to weaken
            unions, all resulting in job insecurity and individualization that
            have weakened the working class.
            </p>
            <p>
            	The quest for greater
            productivity and profitability over competitors has also resulted in
            a resurgence and exponential increase in &quot;globalization&quot;
            (which had never disappeared). In a traditional way, imperialists
            transferred millions of jobs to countries where production costs were
            more advantageous for them. These transfers led, in imperialist
            countries, to rising unemployment, used by bosses to blackmail the
            working class and attempt to curb resistance. But they also led to
            the development of the working class (or even its emergence) in the
            countries that recovered the production. The most emblematic case is,
            of course, China, which, as a deformed workers' state, has completely
            differentiated itself from other countries by giving itself the means
            to take advantage of this in the medium term.</p>
            <p>
            	The union bureaucracies in the
            imperialist countries, which for decades have been holding back or
            misleading workers' struggles, found themselves torn apart. As
            co-managers of the companies (and beneficiaries of the capitalist
            system), they could only approve of such measures, but they found
            themselves confronted by their rank and file, who bore the brunt of
            the effects of these measures. They generally tried to pit workers
            from different countries against each other, pointing to low wages,
            working conditions, or the banning of unions, without even noticing
            that these &quot;poor wages&quot; (from the perspective of developed
            western countries) often allowed peasants to escape the abject
            poverty of their countryside.</p>
            <p>
            	For there is no solution within
            the capitalist system. Only a worldwide planning of the economy can
            allow for a fair distribution of work among all and decent working
            and living conditions for all the workers of the planet. This will
            only be possible with the complete overthrow of the capitalist
            system. Capital's labor lieutenants, whether the union bureaucracies
            or the &quot;left&quot; labor-bourgeois parties and their &quot;far-left&quot;
            touts, seek only to maintain their privileges by protecting the
            interests of those who feed them, their national capitalists. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	Within this national framework
            imposed by the political or union &quot;left,&quot; the struggles of
            the working classes, who, with their backs against the wall, tried to
            stop the slaughter, have failed. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In most advanced capitalist
            countries, the working class has shrunk sharply
            (&quot;deindustrialization&quot;), and union leaderships have lost
            their credibility and most of their members. In developing countries
            (apart from China, which must be treated separately), the working
            classes are still far from being organized to the level they should
            be, even if progress has been made (despite chauvinistic western
            union leaderships).</p>
            <p>
            	While this may seem
            paradoxical, reality forces us to note that today it is very
            difficult for workers, except in the few sectors that are still
            protected or the highly qualified sectors of the labor aristocracy,
            to go on strike. The risks are all the greater since the unions have
            been considerably weakened, and their leaderships have for many years
            demonstrated greater concern for employers&rsquo; interests than for
            the needs of their base.</p>
            
            <p><h3>The decline of working-class consciousness</h3></p>
            <p>
            	These setbacks for the working
            class were accompanied and reinforced by the decline in working-class
            consciousness. With the destruction of the USSR, the working class
            and the oppressed around the world witnessed the sudden collapse of a
            country they perceived, despite its distortions, as a bulwark against
            imperialist attacks. Two major factors exacerbated the effects of
            this global defeat. The first is that most of the leaderships of the
            workers' movement, which had supported the anti-Soviet campaigns,
            celebrated the end of the USSR alongside their bourgeoisies (and the
            further to the left you went, the louder the cheers became ). The
            second is that the bourgeoisies around the world, intoxicated by
            their victory, waged a vast anti-communist crusade with an incessant
            bombardment clamoring and proclaiming that, supposedly, &quot;communism
            was dead.&quot; This decades-long barrage had an even stronger impact
            on workers because their own union and political leaders (including
            in the &ldquo;Trotskyist left,&rdquo; where some took advantage of
            the situation to get rid of &ldquo;dead weight like the &quot;dictatorship
            of the proletariat&quot;) actively took part in it.</p>
            <p>
            <br/>

            </p>
            <p>
            	Combined with the accumulating
            defeats, the aspiration and hope for a society other than capitalism
            &mdash; a society in which the working class would lead &mdash; have
            faded.  The new generations of workers found themselves with
            organizations and activists that left them with no other option than
            to scrounge for scraps in this corrupt system.  The level of
            working-class consciousness spiraled downward, plummeting into an
            endless abyss. Very quickly, symbols such as the red flag or the
            hammer and sickle disappeared from the demonstrations, while the idea
            of communism as the only solution to capitalism gradually eroded.
            Perrault and the ICL, with their mantra of not 
            <a href="https://iclfi.org/spartacist/en/2024-liberalism">&quot;seek refuge in
            abstract phrase-mongering about revolution&quot;</a>
            in order to be <a href="https://iclfi.org/spartacist/en/2024-liberalism">&quot;a 
            living factor&quot;</a> represent a perfect adaptation to the results of this crusade 
            against the so-called &quot;death of communism&quot;, joining, under this
            pretext, the ranks of &quot;the left,&quot; placing themselves from
            the outset on the right wing of the &quot;socialist left.</p>
            
            <p><h3>The ICL refused to face reality</h3></p>
            <p>
            	The level of consciousness of
            the working class determines the general perspectives of
            revolutionaries and must be translated into programmatic terms. If a
            significant change in outlook had been raised in the ICL at one time
            to take into account the consequences of the destruction of the USSR
            and of this decline in consciousness, in
            the end it was never implemented (with all due respect to the
            Internationalist Group). Clinging to
            more appealing (but illusory) prospects,
            the ICL (like the various groups emerging from the &quot;Spartacist
            tendency&quot;) has gone through the entire post-Soviet period
            continuing to propose virtually unchanged transitional programs.
            While the ICL responded to every direct attack on the workers
            movement with its propaganda, the succession of setbacks suffered by
            the working classes was never studied or analyzed as such, even
            though doing so would have allowed the party to intervene in a way
            that matched the actual condition of those working classes. The same
            goes for the slow erosion of working-class consciousness, which was
            never properly acknowledged, studied, or recognized for what it truly
            was, at any point in time.  
            </p>
            <p>
            As working conditions have
            steadily and inexorably deteriorated, they now bear
            little resemblance to those of 30 years ago. This is what gradually
            caused the ICL's programs to become increasingly out of step with the
            reality of the working class and, little by little, to
            lose any and all relevance.</p>
            <p>
            	While this observation seems
            simple, it is quite astonishing to note that no so-called
            revolutionary organization, nor the ICL, ever dared to frankly
            acknowledge what was happening. For its own reasons, the ICL, like
            the others, turned a blind eye and denied this reality, refusing to
            draw the programmatic conclusions that flowed from it.</p>
            
            <p><h3>Declining
            Consciousness and a Transitional Program</h3></p>
            <p>
            	The <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/tp/tp-text.htm#mt">system 
                    of transitional demands</a>,
            the basis of the Trotskyist program, aims to establish a bridge
            &quot;<i>stemming from
            today&rsquo;s conditions and from today&rsquo;s consciousness of wide
            layers of the working class and unalterably leading to one final
            conclusion: the conquest of power by the proletariat</i>.&quot;
            Therefore, for this system to work, it is imperative to start from
            the <i><b>real level of consciousness</b></i> of
            the working class, and not from an idealized or fantasized level.
            Otherwise, this &quot;bridge&quot; bypasses the working class
            consciousness. And the lower the level of consciousness, the more
            abstract and propagandistic the question of seizing power will be. By
            no longer taking into account the real needs of the workers, the
            programs of the ICL have turned into mere invocations rather than a
            means of intervening to raise working-class consciousness.</p>
            <p>
            	Today, the &quot;Spartacist&quot;
            groups find themselves in a state of great confusion. All implicitly,
            and wrongly, assume that the working class is in the process of
            recovering. Everyone confuses defensive actions &mdash; after years
            of attacks by the bourgeoisie &mdash; with offensive actions. A
            deadly confusion. It is typical, for example, that 
            <a href="https://iclfi.org/pubs/lb/233/syndicats">the LTF denounced
            the LO reformists</a> because they
            dare to recognize and assert that there
            has been a regression in the level of consciousness
            of working-class
            in France (of course, this costs LO nothing, allowing it to further
            justify its reformist program, since it has not implemented the
            transition
            program for a very long time). We'll
            examine further in upcoming posts this critical issue
            of overestimating
            the possibilities for working-class struggles, starting with the
            movement against the 2023 pension reform in France
            &mdash; the
            country we're least unfamiliar with.</p>
            <p>
            	Since its reappearance in 2021,
            the ICL has clearly broken with the Transitional Program. While the
            new leaders have returned to the classic minimum-maximum program (a
            series of basic demands sprinkled with calls to seize power or
            revolution), it seems that over the past several months they have
            been slowly shifting their focus to the minimum program (all the
            &quot;phrases&quot; of the maximum program on revolution or communism
            have been declared &quot;abstract&quot;), now sprinkled with recipes
            for combativeness.</p>
            
            <p><h3>Declining consciousness and
            abandoning the revolutionary program</h3></p>
            <p>
            	Recognizing the true level of
            workers' consciousness, yet obvious, seems anathema to the
            organizations of the &quot;Spartacist current,&quot; particularly the
            ICL or the Internationalist Group. Recognizing that it is extremely
            low would lead them to label us as &quot;pessimists,&quot;
            &quot;demoralized,&quot; or &quot;defeatists,&quot; this question
            being completely avoided, by everyone. The case of the ICL is
            emblematic. While the former ICL regularly recalled that the
            Transitional Program is the means of raising working-class
            consciousness (even if this level became largely fantasized), all
            reference to the Transitional Program has now completely disappeared
            from the ICL.</p>
            <p>
            	We'll examine further
            the reasons for the ICL's abandonment of the Transitional Program and
            its constant programmatic shifts. But it is clear that, with the ICL
            shifting from &quot;fighter of the socialist revolution&quot; to 
            <a href="https://iclfi.org/spartacist/en/68/comintern">&quot;not
            only the best but the only consistent fighters for national
            liberation&quot;</a> the Transitional Program is
            now useless and dead weight.
            As with all petty-bourgeois organizations, the working class has
            become a mere auxiliary. All the ICL asks of it is, at best, to fight
            and put
            all its weight into supporting and helping
            &quot;the left&quot;
            (the &quot;social traitors&quot; in Lenin's texts) rebuild itself and
            regain its former glory, or to lend a helping hand to the national
            bourgeoisies. For the ICL, all this represents  the first stage of a
            future proletarian revolution. Breaking with a century of trotskyism,
            the ICL embraces the classic stageism, with which, historically, the
            first stage has always resulted, despite the &quot;promises,&quot; in
            more or less bloody defeats. This stageism is embodied in the
            plethora of &quot;fronts&quot; and other &quot;poles&quot;
            (&quot;anti-imperialist&quot;, &quot;workers'&quot;, &quot;of
            defense&quot;, etc.).</p>
            <p>
            	Our predecessors (Engels, Marx,
            Lenin, Trotsky, etc.) spent an enormous amount of time grasping what
            was happening in the global workers' movement, its relationship with
            the bourgeoisie, its level of organization and consciousness, etc.,
            in order to establish a program to be able to intervene effectively.
            Without such observations, as we have seen for more than thirty
            years, this only leads to confusion, demoralization, and results in
            isolation and degeneration.</p>
            <p>
            	The perspectives of the
            revolutionary party are absolutely not the same when the working
            class is advancing, confronting and challenging the capitalists (and
            their labor lieutenants), as when it is on the defensive, backed
            against the wall and without direction, suffering their attacks. The
            paragraph by Trotsky
            in <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1937/08/stalinism.htm">the epigraph</a>
            of this text, written in 1937 (after the defeats of the popular
            fronts in France and Spain and as war in Europe loomed) summarizes
            what should have been, for the ICL (and the IBT at the time), the
            basis for reflecting on and preparing for the
            consequences of the defeat in the USSR. The
            hope for better times to come, undoubtedly more reassuring and less
            depressing, was the prevailing mood
            and prevented any serious analysis of what was happening. Of course,
            thirty years later,
            it is difficult to say precisely what should
            have been said and done, especially since the decline of the working
            class was irregular and unfolded
            over the whole period.
            But the hindsight we have is an advantage and an opportunity
            to reexamine history (without rewriting it as some do), and draw
            lessons from it.</p>
            <p>
            	Obviously, this situation is
            not eternal. The working class will overcome its difficulties at some
            point. But for the near future, we find ourselves with the upper
            layers of the working class, the labor aristocracy and the
            bureaucrats, who cling to the coattails of the so-called &quot;democratic&quot;
            or &quot;national&quot; bourgeoisie. A minority fraction of the
            working class, as the capitalist system sinks deeper into economic
            crisis and &quot;democratic&quot; politicians find themselves
            completely discredited, is desperate and turns to all manner of
            populists and sovereignists. As for the rest, they endure, contain
            their anger, and retreat in wait-and-see inaction and abstention in
            order to survive.</p>
            
            <p><h2>The unconditional defense of China</h2></p>
            <p>
            	The current situation can be
            characterized as the entry into the final phase of the decline of US
            imperialism. Many people and organizations are talking about it. But
            the present and future consequences of this decline are rarely fully
            appreciated. Accelerated by the Great Depression that followed the
            2007-2008 crisis, this decline has resulted in a series of wars,
            sanctions, massacres, and other dirty tricks.</p>
            
            <p><h3>US imperialism will hang on</h3></p>
            <p>
            	The decline of imperialism,
            which has dominated the world unchallenged for nearly 80 years, is
            not without its ups and downs. And these will accelerate because, to
            defend its position, US imperialism will use all the means at its
            disposal to try to continue dominating the world, means which, in the
            imperialist world, are always the same: trying to destroy those who
            try to oppose it, whether through economic wars or outright wars. It
            has two solutions available
            to try to halt its decline. The first is to
            go after its imperialist competitors a little more forcefully.
            And Trump shows even more clearly than during his first time in
            Washington that he
            will not hesitate. Even if its &quot;MAGA&quot; populism, its
            thunderous and grandiloquent declarations are out of step with the
            reality of its power - economic, political and military - the USA are
            still the leading world power, with an extraordinary ability to cause
            harm. Damage that will hit the least developed countries hardest (the
            &quot;shithole countries&quot; as Trump calls them), but which will
            also hit &quot;friendly&quot; developed countries. Including those
            led or who will be led by European populists, who risk having to
            choose between making their populations pay (and turning against
            them) or opposing their populist friend Trump. What is certain is
            that the isolationist policies of &quot;MAGA&quot; will only
            accelerate the decline of US imperialist hegemony, which can only be
            beneficial to the oppressed around the world (including in the USA). 
            </p>
            <p>
            	The other solution for US
            imperialism, becoming more complicated every day, would be the
            destruction of the deformed Chinese workers' state, whether
            economically or militarily. This has become a clear priority since
            late 2011 with the Obama/Clinton &quot;pivot to Asia.&quot; Attempts
            to contain China have intensified, first under Trump I, who had
            started it, then with Biden, who has amplified them, but without much
            success and, above all, without halting the decline of the USA. What
            will guide Trump II will be, more than ever, an attempt to focus its
            actions on this dual objective.</p>
            
            <p><h3>The ICL capitulates on China</h3></p>
            <p>
            The question of the
            unconditional defense of the Chinese deformed workers' state is more
            than ever the &quot;Russian question&quot; of today. If the ICL was
            at its post for the defense of the USSR (with weaknesses to which we
            will return), it is clear that the ICL leaders have deserted the post
            with regard to the Chinese deformed workers' state. Their abandonment
            of the Trotskyist program towards China &mdash; for a program similar
            to Schachtman's toward the USSR when he left the Fourth International
            &mdash; is blatant with the abandonment of the fundamental slogan of
            &quot;unconditional defense of China.&quot; This word,
            &quot;unconditional,&quot; only appears clearly, as with Schachtman,
            when the ICL refers to a China that is &quot;genuinely threatened&quot;
            by US imperialism. And since Trump's election and Perrault's
            &quot;discovery&quot; that <a href="../../b/docs/doc-b-002.html#ultra1">ultra-imperialism
            existed</a> (or even
            &quot;hyper-mega-ultra-imperialism&quot;), we note that the LCI has
            brought back this slogan (of course, within the framework of its
            &ldquo;nationalist anti-imperialism&rdquo;). From the trotskyist
            point of view, this position amounts to adding a condition for
            speaking about &quot;unconditionally&quot; defending China. This
            position goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the
            characterization of the 
            <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/revbet/ch09.htm#ch09-2"
			class="instant-tooltip" data-tooltip="see 'Is the Bureaucracy a Ruling Class ?'">dual 
            nature of the bureaucracy</a>.
            The one and only nature attributed to the Chinese bureaucracy by the
            ICL: reactionary (summed up by Perrault's mantra &quot;be tough on
            the Stalinists&quot;). Thus the defense of China is no longer &quot;the
            Russian question&quot; of today, but a stance that reformists,
            &quot;third-worldists&quot; and bourgeois or petty-bourgeois
            nationalists can just as easily assume in certain circumstances .</p>
            <p>
            	It is at the heart of the
            imperialist beast, in the USA, that this break between the ICL and
            trotskyism is the most blatant and striking. The SLUS found itself,
            <a href="../../e/docs/doc-e-001.html#lettredem1">once again</a>, 
            running a US &quot;electoral campaign&quot; (that of
            2024) with a front page of a <i><a href="https://iclfi.org/pubs/wv/1182">WV</a></i>
            that <i><b>does not mention China</b></i>
            (!) while it had become a race among the Democratic and Republican
            imperialist dogs to see which could bark the loudest against China.
            The surviving SLUS activists distributed at picket lines a newspaper
            and leaflets that do not mention or call for the defense of China
            against their imperialism. The SLUS vociferates against the union
            leaderships, but never on the fact that they are hand in glove with
            the US capitalists in the campaigns against China to defend the
            interests of &quot;their capitalists,&quot; to safeguard &quot;their
            privileges&quot; as rotten bureaucrats, and to tie the workers to the
            chariot of their bourgeoisie on China. Saying the SLUS went bankrupt
            doesn't even begin to cover it. The US section of the ICL,
            &quot;historic,&quot; which still has the most activists today, sells
            the most newspapers, fills the ICL's bank accounts and holds its
            family jewels, is, by virtue of its position &quot;at the heart of
            the beast,&quot; the one whose betrayal is the most remarkable and
            repugnant.</p>
            <p>
            	The other sections are not to
            be outdone. Like the SpAD, promoted by the ICL, which can 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EmzP-1QU-U&t=16s">debate
            courteously</a> with an anti-Soviet organization (the
            MLPD), which supported the destruction of the DDR and the USSR
            (alongside the imperialists), boasts about it, and is ready to do it
            again against &quot;capitalist/imperialist China.&quot; And the SpAD
            proclaims the MLPD &quot;anti-German imperialist&quot; and 
            <a href="https://x.com/spartakist_IKL/status/1891083847141343439">has
            fielded an MLPD candidate</a> in the elections (and,
            moreover, the height of cynicism, a DDR activist won over to the ICL
            on... the defense of the DDR)!</p>
            <p>
            	We will return extensively to
            the Stalinophobic positions that the ICL is currently using to
            justify its capitulations.</p>
            
            <p><h2>Decline
            of US imperialism</h2> <h2>and unprecedented global situation</h2></p>
            <p>
            	The decline of US imperialism
            will lead to an entirely new and unprecedented global
            reconfiguration, which will open a new historical period. The new
            leaders of the ICL, like many others, sense this new period. To
            confront it their solution is simple: break with trotskyism. As is
            often the case in the history of the workers' movement during times
            of global turmoil in the world, the ICL is no exception to the rule,
            turning resolutely and firmly towards revisionism and liquidationism.
            They are abandoning the revolutionary program for classic &quot;shortcuts&quot;
            that we know where they lead. In the imperialist countries, the main
            task is to advise &quot;the left&quot; so that it 
            <a href="https://iclfi.org/pubs/wv/1183/us-tasks">&quot;bridges the
            gulf between itself and the working class&quot;</a>.
            The ICL would thus like to be admitted as a link in the syphilitic
            chain of the reformist swamp in total decay (and not the last link!).
            In other countries, their abandonment of the Permanent revolution and
            their enthronement of the policy of the &quot;anti-imperialist united
            front&quot; (we would add &quot;strategic&quot;, more politically
            precise) lead them, again as the whole history of the last century
            has shown, into the mire of class collaboration with national
            capitalists (<a href="https://iclfi.org/pubs/tap-en/2024-02-23-edca">the Philippines</a>)
            and to exhort minority nations, in multinational countries 
            (<a href="https://iclfi.org/spartacist/en/68/permrev">Iran, Sri
            Lanka</a>, etc.), to capitulate to the dominant nationalists. We will return to
            this in detail.</p>
            
            <p><h3>No imperialist successor to
            the US imperialists</h3></p>
            <p>
            	Interimperialist rivalries have
            never ceased, and were rekindled after the destruction of the USSR.
            But, as the ICL has repeatedly explained, US imperialism has always
            taken meticulous care 
            <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/spartacist-us/1988-1993/0047-0048_Winter_1992-93.pdf">to
             weaken its potential imperialist rivals</a>
            (mainly Germany and Japan) and ensure its world domination
            and claim the lion's share of its plunder.
            The latest blow it
            dealt to German imperialism with the war in Ukraine is a perfect
            illustration of this. From this perspective, the destruction of Nord
            Stream 2 was particularly shrewd and effective.</p>
            <p>
            	As it intensifies, one of the
            consequences of this decline of the world's leading imperialist power
            will lead to a major global upheaval. This was also the case when
            British imperialism began its final phase of world domination. At the
            time, US imperialism, in both &quot;world wars,&quot; had skillfully
            taken care to let its competitors tear each other apart and slaughter
            each other before intervening. The second, in which it managed to
            annihilate its japanese rival itself, allowed it to take the place of
            British imperialism by driving the final nails into its coffin.</p>
            <p>
            	Now its time has come, but it
            is not another imperialism that is driving the nails into its coffin,
            since no other imperialism is capable of taking its place
            (considering their political, economic, and military state).
            Especially since, in its decline, US imperialism will attack its
            rivals to try to save its own skin. Whether with Biden or Trump's
            MAGA (even if the two factions of US imperialism do not have the same
            approach), it is no longer capable of recreating, against China, the
            anti-Soviet bloc. 
            </p>
            
            <p><h3>China as a pole</h3></p>
            <p>
            	From this chaos, the deformed
            Chinese workers' state will emerge as the main economic and military
            pole. This will be the first time in history that a workers' state
            will face imperialists who are weakened, divided, discredited in most
            countries of the world, and hardly able to unite. This situation does
            not call into question marxist theory or trotskyist analyses. It will
            be a new configuration that could never have been envisaged before.
            Because the situation was not conducive to it  (England and then the
            USA dominated during the existence of the USSR). Because the
            emergence of China, relatively recent, has never been correctly
            considered and characterized politically by anyone, particularly by
            all the organizations that consider China &quot;capitalist,&quot;
            completely off the mark and in total contradiction with marxist
            theory, or by those who politically support China (Stalinists,
            nationalists, etc.). 
            </p>
            <p>
            	The IST/ICL also had
            difficulties with China's development, especially when
            that development accelerated. It began to vacillate over the nature of the
            bureaucracy, often seeing it as 
            essentially <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/workersvanguard/1999/0725_10_12_1999.pdf"> 
            restorationist</a>.
            While the bureaucracy advocates socialism in one country and peaceful
            coexistence, it is the working-class nature of the state (even if
            deformed) that has enabled China's economic, scientific, and
            technological development, advancements from which workers, peasants,
            women, youth, and all minorities have benefited. Of course,
            developing these trotskyist positions would contradict the ICL's new
            central task of 
            <a href="https://iclfi.org/spartacist/en/70/editorial">advising 
            the virulently anti-China &quot;left&quot;</a>.
            To satisfy its appetites, the first step for the ICL is to break with
            the trotskyist program, which demands an uncompromising struggle
            against all those organizations that are merely links seeking to
            chain the working class to its capitalist masters.</p>
            <p>
            	The destruction of the Chinese
            deformed workers' state will become an increasingly challenging and
            problematic issue for the US high command and political personnel.
            Countries aspiring to wage a proxy war against China for the benefit
            of the US are scrutinizing the results of the -- lost -- US proxy war
            in Ukraine. Anti-communist fervor may be cooling somewhat, especially
            since China is not quite in the same league as Russia, whether in
            terms of its economy and industry, population and cohesion, military,
            geographic location, etc. Moreover, the governments of the most
            belligerent countries that could potentially commit to the US
            military (Korea or Japan, for example) do not particularly benefit
            from the support of their populations, nor from a favorable
            perception among their colleagues in Asia, nor from a thriving
            economy, while they are likely to be affected by the MAGA wave of
            their colleague Trump. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	Time is working against US
            imperialism, even though it has benefited (and still benefits) from
            the historic policy of peaceful coexistence of the Chinese
            bureaucracy, which has never sought to weaken US imperialism (or any
            other) from within by calling on the US working class to mobilize
            against its bourgeoisie. And unfortunately, with the ICL's break with
            trotskyism, the US working class has just lost the most important
            embryo of a revolutionary party that could have prepared it for its
            historic tasks.</p>
            
            <p><h3>A historic turning point for
            the US proletarians</h3></p>
            <p>
            	In an article written in 1885
            (reprinted in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1icgQfi21HfzNCf8C836dmaPIpJt7y1Y7/view?usp=drivesdk"
            class="instant-tooltip" data-tooltip="see pages 257 to 269">the 
            preface to the 1892 </a>german edition of &quot;The Condition of the
            Working Class in England in 1844&quot;), Engels comments on the very
            beginnings of the decline of the English industrial monopoly, with
            initial consequences such as the shutdown of business, stagnation,
            and misery for the workers. And he explains what he thinks will
            happen to the working class: <i>&quot;&quot;The
            truth is this&nbsp;: during the period of England's industrial
            monopoly the English working class have, to a certain extent, shared
            in the benefits of the monopoly. These benefits were very unequally
            parcelled out amongst them&nbsp;; the privileged minority pocketed
            most, but even the great mass had, at least, a temporary share now
            and then. And that is the reason why, since the dying-out of Owenism,
            there has been no Socialism in England. With the breakdown of that
            monopoly, the English working class will lose that privileged
            position&nbsp;; it will find itself generally &mdash; the privileged
            and leading minority not excepted &mdash; on a level with its
            fellow-workers abroad. And that is the reason why there will be
            Socialism again in England.&quot;</i></p>
            <p>
            	This reasoning can perfectly well be applied to the USA (and, all things 
            considered, the same applies to all other imperialist countries). The slowdown in the
            imperialist plundering of the world (and the distribution of its
            crumbs to the <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/pref02.htm">labor
            aristocracy</a> may open up the historical possibility of finally seeing the US
            working class break free from the interests of its own bourgeoisie
            and begin to use its power against it. And revolutionaries must
            prepare themselves and a potential workers' vanguard for these
            moments which are likely to be very painful.</p>
            <p>
            	That the leadership of the
            SLUS/LCI chose this precise moment to make its final and fatal turn
            of abandoning trotskyism is absolutely not surprising. Faced with the
            impending maelstrom, the ICL sees history &quot;biting at its neck&quot;
            and, like <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/spartacist-us/1972-1980/0021_Fall_1972.pdf">the 
            pabloists</a> at the beginning of the Cold War, begins by liquidating the
            revolutionary program and abandoning the marxist compass for a much
            more proven means of orientation to satisfy its appetites: the wet
            finger, better able to orient itself according to the prevailing
            winds of &quot;the left&quot; and the &quot;national bourgeoisies.&quot;</p>
            
            <p><h3>Towards a &quot;multipolar&quot;
            world ?</h3></p>
            <p>
            	The decline of the US will mean
            increasingly difficult times for it to plunder the entire planet and
            a weakening of other imperialisms. The effects of this new situation
            will be numerous and hard to foresee. Countries that have been under
            the direct domination of the imperialists and have been plundered for
            decades or centuries will regain some freedom of action and a little
            room for maneuver. They will be able to get their hands on some of
            the resources currently ending up in Western banks. The national
            bourgeoisies (or the military) will find themselves more weakened
            compared to populations who, due to the imperialists' retreat, will
            raise their heads a little and undoubtedly demand more. These will be
            openings for the working class. The same will be true for all other
            non-imperialist capitalist countries. In imperialist countries, as
            Engels indicates, the decline in the plundering of the world will
            mean for the working classes that their &quot;advantageous position&quot;
            will decline to approach that of workers in the rest of the world. We
            can hope that worker militancy will develop either during the
            nationalist-protectionist wave or afterward.</p>
            <p>
            	We can see all these phenomena
            taking place today on a very small scale. For example, in the African
            neo-colonies of French imperialism, where the French army is kicked
            out, without French imperialism (or any other imperialism, for that
            matter) being able to do anything about it. With a large portion of
            the population celebrating this departure, the military regimes in
            power know that their room for maneuver
            is very limited as any failure on their part would result in a
            painful return of other military forces
            which the imperialists, French or otherwise, would rush to propel
            forward.
            In the imperialist
            countries, we also have the beginnings of what will happen with the
            automotive sector (manufacturers, equipment suppliers, etc.), where
            hundreds of thousands of jobs will be lost and where
            we can observe the positioning and impotence of &quot;the left&quot;
            (including its extreme fringe) and union bureaucrats. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	What will be vital at
            this moment will be a revolutionary organization. Since all the old,
            moribund leaderships of the workers' movement (or nationalists of any
            kind) who have led the workers up the garden path will attempt, as
            always, to confine resentments and movements within the capitalist
            framework. All the so-called revolutionary or trotskyist
            organizations that for decades have served and continue to serve as
            beaters and footstools for the official labor lieutenants of the
            bourgeoisie will once again try to play their deadly tunes. It is at
            this moment that &quot;the program of transitional demands will gain
            burning actuality&quot; (&quot;<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/tp/tp-text.htm#iw">The Transitional
            Program&quot;</a>).
            These are the moments that must begin to be prepared so that the new
            generation of activists can avoid the traps that the capitalists and
            their &quot;left-wing&quot; lackeys of all kinds will set to try to
            delay the deadline and lead the workers to failure.</p>
            <p>
            	An important transitional
            programmatic axis of the revolutionary party to guide the working
            class will be to make it learn the lessons that decadent capitalism
            is incapable of delivering a decent life and a decent world. This is
            only possible with a globally planned economy. But for this to
            happen, it is necessary to overthrow the capitalists, not only in
            one's own country, but also all capitalists in other countries by
            allying with other working classes. To achieve this, it will be
            necessary to regenerate (and, most of the time, rebuild) the
            organizations of the workers' movement on revolutionary foundations.
            This is how the working class will be able to evolve from a class in
            itself to a class for itself.</p>
            <p>
            	For China (and other deformed
            workers' states), the pressures will shift. The petty bourgeoisie or
            capitalists attracted by &quot;western democracy&quot; or
            reactionaries of all kinds (religious, nationalist, etc.) supported
            by the imperialists &mdash; all these individuals will have the rug
            pulled out from under them. The restorationist danger will take a big
            hit, and a few years will be gained, which will be a good thing. If
            we can envisage a renewal of struggles in the capitalist world, with
            imperialists in retreat, we could envisage that the Chinese working
            class could begin to question the policy of peaceful coexistence,
            seek to join with its brothers in the capitalist countries, question
            the waste that &quot;market socialism&quot; represents and frame the
            issue of workers' planning, not only in China, but on a global level.
            Such questioning will immediately polarize the bureaucracy and the
            PLA.</p>
            <p>
            	But whether in China or in the
            capitalist world, the problem of the workers' level of consciousness
            remains and will remain the central issue to be resolved. After
            decades of setbacks and defeats in the capitalist world and of
            stalinist domination in China, this new historical period will
            undoubtedly enable new possibilities, with new layers of activists
            emerging.
            The key issue will be to re-educate them in the fundamentals of
            marxism, that the perspective must be the establishment of a
            classless, communist society. Even if the old organizations, with
            their decades of betrayals, are weakened and fairly discredited, it
            will take a fierce struggle by revolutionaries to prevent them from
            once again leading this new generation into the dead ends of
            reformism. Even weak revolutionary forces could, in these
            circumstances, find their way to the vanguard of the workers, with
            the program of transitional demands becoming more urgent than ever
            and acquiring a multiplied power.</p>
            <p>
            	The near disappearance of the
            trotskyists, the only ones capable of carrying out this work, is a
            real problem. A break in continuity would be a terrible ordeal.
            Maintaining a thread of communication, however tenuous, and
            maintaining ideological clarity and principles are more than
            necessary. We have only derisory resources and can only try to help
            maintain and preserve these principles, starting with trying to
            understand why the TSI/ICL failed.</p>
